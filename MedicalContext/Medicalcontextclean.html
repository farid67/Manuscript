In their latest statistical report, the World Health Organization ranked it as the fifth cancer type in terms of incidence with about 841,000 new cases annually, and as the fourth cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with about 782,000 annual deaths. Mortality and incidence rates are between 2 and 3 times higher among men than women in most regions of the world, making it the second type of cancer in terms of deaths for males.

To acquire this </span><span>hepatobiliary</span><span>&nbsp;phase, which can exclusively be obtained on MRI, different agents exist, and they mainly differ in their hepatocellular uptake, thus reaching an enhancement at different moments. In the exception to the delayed phase for some specific agents, the normal phases can be acquired, along with some new phases such as the &ldquo;transitional phase&rdquo;, which represent a transition from extracellular-dominant to intracellular-dominant enhancement [</span><span class="c6">ref 116 of Choi et al.</span><span>].<br>Unlike extracellular agents, the hepatobiliary contrast agents show promise for differentiating early </span><span class="c0">HCCs</span><span>&nbsp;and premalignant nodules from lower-risk nodules [</span><span class="c6">ref 31-37 of Choi Part2 et al.</span><span>].<br></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 539.60px; height: 395.21px;"><img alt="" src="images/image12.png" style="width: 539.60px; height: 395.21px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></li></ul><p class="c5"><span>Main advantages of choosing CT over MRI examination is that it is widely available, rapid, robust and requires less expertise than MRI when interpreting images.
