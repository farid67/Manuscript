Investigators have been encouraged to publish their clinical and imaging data as part of fulfilling their grant obligations. Realizing it was not sufficient to merely ask investigators to publish their collection of imaging and clinical data, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) created the open source National Biomedical Image Archive software package as a mechanism for centralized hosting of cancer related imaging. NCI has contracted with Washington University in Saint Louis to create The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)---an open-source, open-access information resource to support research, development, and educational initiatives utilizing advanced medical imaging of cancer. In its first year of operation, TCIA accumulated 23 collections (3.3 million images). Operating and maintaining a high-availability image archive is a complex challenge involving varied archive-specific resources and driven by the needs of both image submitters and image consumers. Quality archives of any type (traditional library, PubMed, refereed journals) require management and customer service. This paper describes the management tasks and user support model for TCIA.",

@article{Jaffe2006,
abstract = {RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) is a widely employed method introduced in 2000 to assess change in tumor size in response to therapy. The simplicity of the technique, however, contrasts sharply with the increasing sophistication of imaging instrumentation. Anatomically based imaging measurement, although supportive of drug development and key to some accelerated drug approvals, is being pressed to improve its methodologic robustness, particularly in the light of more functionally-based imaging that is sensitive to tissue molecular response such as fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. Nevertheless ready availability of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging machines largely assures anatomically based imaging a continuing role in clinical trials for the foreseeable future. Recent advances in image processing enabled by the computational power of modern clinical scanners open a considerable opportunity to characterize tumor response to therapy as a complement to image acquisition. Various alternative quantitative volumetric approaches have been proposed but have yet to gain wide acceptance by clinical and regulatory communities, nor have these more complex techniques shown incontrovertible evidence of greater reproducibility or predictive value of clinical events and outcome. Unless plans are created for clinical trials that incorporate the design needed to prove the added value and unique clinical utility of these novel approaches, any theoretical benefit of these more elaborate methods could remain unfulfilled.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in signal processing and machine learning coupled with developments of electronic medical record keeping in hospitals and the availability of extensive set of medical images through internal/external communication systems, have resulted in a recent surge of significant interest in "Radiomics". Radiomics is an emerging and relatively new research field, which refers to extracting semi-quantitative and/or quantitative features from medical images with the goal of developing predictive and/or prognostic models, and is expected to become a critical component for integration of image-derived information for personalized treatment in the near future. The conventional Radiomics workflow is typically based on extracting pre-designed features (also referred to as hand-crafted or engineered features) from a segmented region of interest. Nevertheless, recent advancements in deep learning have caused trends towards deep learning-based Radiomics (also referred to as discovery Radiomics). Considering the advantages of these two approaches, there are also hybrid solutions developed to exploit the potentials of multiple data sources. Considering the variety of approaches to Radiomics, further improvements require a comprehensive and integrated sketch, which is the goal of this article. This manuscript provides a unique interdisciplinary perspective on Radiomics by discussing state-of-the-art signal processing solutions in the context of Radiomics.},

@article{Sahani2014,
abstract = {Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in both men and women in the United States. Liver is a common site of tumor spread and in approximately 30{\%} of the cases; synchronous liver disease is present at the time of diagnosis. Early detection of liver metastases is crucial to appropriately select patients who may benefit from hepatic resection among those needing chemotherapy, to improve 5-year survival. Advances in imaging techniques have contributed greatly to the management of these patients. Multidetector computed tomography is the most useful test for initial staging and in posttreatment surveillance settings. Magnetic resonance imaging is considered superior to multidetector computed tomography and positron emission tomography for the detection and characterization of small lesions and for liver evaluation in the presence of background fatty liver changes. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography has a problem-solving role in the detection of distant metastasis and in posttreatment evaluation. The advanced imaging methods also serve a role in selecting appropriate patients for radiologically targeted therapies and in monitoring response to conventional and novel therapies.},

@article{Li2018,
abstract = {Liver cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death. To assist doctors in hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis and treatment planning, an accurate and automatic liver and tumor segmentation method is highly demanded in the clinical practice. Recently, fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs), including 2D and 3D FCNs, serve as the back-bone in many volumetric image segmentation. However, 2D convolutions can not fully leverage the spatial information along the third dimension while 3D convolutions suffer from high computational cost and GPU memory consumption. To address these issues, we propose a novel hybrid densely connected UNet (H-DenseUNet), which consists of a 2D DenseUNet for efficiently extracting intra-slice features and a 3D counterpart for hierarchically aggregating volumetric contexts under the spirit of the auto-context algorithm for liver and tumor segmentation. We formulate the learning process of H-DenseUNet in an end-to-end manner, where the intra-slice representations and inter-slice features can be jointly optimized through a hybrid feature fusion (HFF) layer. We extensively evaluated our method on the dataset of MICCAI 2017 Liver Tumor Segmentation (LiTS) Challenge and 3DIRCADb Dataset. Our method outperformed other state-of-the-arts on the segmentation results of tumors and achieved very competitive performance for liver segmentation even with a single model.},

Twenty four valid state-of-the-art liver and liver tumor segmentation algorithms were applied to a set of 131 computed tomography (CT) volumes with different types of tumor contrast levels (hyper-/hypo-intense), abnormalities in tissues (metastasectomie) size and varying amount of lesions. The submitted algorithms have been tested on 70 undisclosed volumes. The dataset is created in collaboration with seven hospitals and research institutions and manually reviewed by independent three radiologists. We found that not a single algorithm performed best for liver and tumors. The best liver segmentation algorithm achieved a Dice score of 0.96(MICCAI) whereas for tumor segmentation the best algorithm evaluated at 0.67(ISBI) and 0.70(MICCAI).

@article{Ganeshan2012,
abstract = {PURPOSE: To establish the potential for tumour heterogeneity in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as assessed by CT texture analysis (CTTA) to provide an independent marker of survival for patients with NSCLC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tumour heterogeneity was assessed by CTTA of unenhanced images of primary pulmonary lesions from 54 patients undergoing (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET-CT for staging of NSCLC. CTTA comprised image filtration to extract fine, medium and coarse features with quantification of the distribution of pixel values (uniformity) within the filtered images. Receiver operating characteristics identified thresholds for PET and CTTA parameters that were related to patient survival using Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: The median (range) survival was 29.5 (1-38) months. 24, 10, 14 and 6 patients had tumour stages I, II, III and IV respectively. PET stage and tumour heterogeneity assessed by CTTA were significant independent predictors of survival (PET stage: Odds ratio 3.85, 95{\%} confidence limits 0.9-8.09, P = 0.002; CTTA: Odds ratio 56.4, 95{\%} confidence limits 4.79-666, p = 0.001). SUV was not a significantly associated with survival. CONCLUSION: Assessment of tumour heterogeneity by CTTA of non-contrast enhanced images has the potential for to provide a novel, independent predictor of survival for patients with NSCLC. KEY POINTS: Computed tomography is a routine staging procedure in non-small cell lung cancer. CT texture analysis (CTTA) can quantify heterogeneity within these lung tumours. CTTA seems to offer a novel independent predictor of survival for NSCLC. CTTA could contribute to disease risk-stratification for patients with NSCLC.},

abstract = {We study the reproducibility of quantitative imaging features that are used to describe tumor shape, size, and texture from computed tomography (CT) scans of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). CT images are dependent on various scanning factors. We focus on characterizing image features that are reproducible in the presence of variations due to patient factors and segmentation methods. Thirty-two NSCLC nonenhanced lung CT scans were obtained from the Reference Image Database to Evaluate Response data set. The tumors were segmented using both manual (radiologist expert) and ensemble (software-automated) methods. A set of features (219 three-dimensional and 110 two-dimensional) was computed, and quantitative image features were statistically filtered to identify a subset of reproducible and nonredundant features. The variability in the repeated experiment was measured by the test-retest concordance correlation coefficient (CCCTreT). The natural range in the features, normalized to variance, was measured by the dynamic range (DR). In this study, there were 29 features across segmentation methods found with CCCTreT and DR ≥ 0.9 and R(2) Bet ≥ 0.95. These reproducible features were tested for predicting radiologist prognostic score; some texture features (run-length and Laws kernels) had an area under the curve of 0.9. The representative features were tested for their prognostic capabilities using an independent NSCLC data set (59 lung adenocarcinomas), where one of the texture features, run-length gray-level nonuniformity, was statistically significant in separating the samples into survival groups (P ≤ .046).},

abstract = {Purpose: To determine whether cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral blood flow can predict the response of high-grade gliomas to radiotherapy (RT) by taking into account spatial heterogeneity and temporal changes in perfusion. Methods and Materials: Twenty-three patients with high-grade gliomas underwent conformal RT, with magnetic resonance imaging perfusion before and at Weeks 1-2 and 3-4 during RT. Tumor perfusion was classified as high, medium, or low. The prognostic values of pre-RT perfusion and the changes during RT for early prediction of tumor response to RT were evaluated. Results: The fractional high-CBV tumor volume before RT and the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging tumor volume were identified as predictors for survival (p = 0.01). Changes in tumor CBV during the early treatment course also predicted for survival. Better survival was predicted by a decrease in the fractional low-CBV tumor volume at Week 1 of RT vs. before RT, a decrease in the fractional high-CBV tumor volume at Week 3 vs. Week 1 of RT, and a smaller pre-RT fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging tumor volume (p = 0.01). Conclusion: Early temporal changes during RT in heterogeneous regions of high and low perfusion in gliomas might predict for different physiologic responses to RT. This might also open the opportunity to identify tumor subvolumes that are radioresistant and might benefit from intensified RT. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED There is evidence in some solid tumors that textural features of tumoral uptake in (18)F-FDG PET images are associated with response to chemoradiotherapy and survival. We have investigated whether a similar relationship exists in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS Fifty-three patients (mean age, 65.8 y; 31 men, 22 women) with NSCLC treated with chemoradiotherapy underwent pretreatment (18)F-FDG PET/CT scans. Response was assessed by CT Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) at 12 wk. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and local PFS (LPFS) were recorded. Primary tumor texture was measured by the parameters coarseness, contrast, busyness, and complexity. The following parameters were also derived from the PET data: primary tumor standardized uptake values (SUVs) (mean SUV, maximum SUV, and peak SUV), metabolic tumor volume, and total lesion glycolysis. RESULTS Compared with nonresponders, RECIST responders showed lower coarseness (mean, 0.012 vs. 0.027; P = 0.004) and higher contrast (mean, 0.11 vs. 0.044; P = 0.002) and busyness (mean, 0.76 vs. 0.37; P = 0.027). Neither complexity nor any of the SUV parameters predicted RECIST response. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, OS, PFS, and LPFS were lower in patients with high primary tumor coarseness (median, 21.1 mo vs. not reached, P = 0.003; 12.6 vs. 25.8 mo, P = 0.002; and 12.9 vs. 20.5 mo, P = 0.016, respectively). Tumor coarseness was an independent predictor of OS on multivariable analysis. Contrast and busyness did not show significant associations with OS (P = 0.075 and 0.059, respectively), but PFS and LPFS were longer in patients with high levels of each (for contrast: median of 20.5 vs. 12.6 mo, P = 0.015, and median not reached vs. 24 mo, P = 0.02; and for busyness: median of 20.5 vs. 12.6 mo, P = 0.01, and median not reached vs. 24 mo, P = 0.006). Neither complexity nor any of the SUV parameters showed significant associations with the survival parameters. CONCLUSION In NSCLC, baseline (18)F-FDG PET scan uptake showing abnormal texture as measured by coarseness, contrast, and busyness is associated with nonresponse to chemoradiotherapy by RECIST and with poorer prognosis. Measurement of tumor metabolic heterogeneity with these parameters may provide indices that can be used to stratify patients in clinical trials for lung cancer chemoradiotherapy.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

Group 1 tumors contained greater volumes of habitats with low contrast enhancement but intermediate and high cell density (not fully necrotic) than group 2. Both leave-one-out and 10-fold cross-validation schemes demonstrated that individual patients could be correctly assigned to the short or long survival group with 81.25{\%} accuracy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: We demonstrate that novel image analytic techniques can characterize regional habitat variations in GBMs using combinations of MRI sequences.

@article{Dose2016,
abstract = {Purpose—To assess the relationship between radiation dose and change in a set of mathematical intensity- and texture-based features and to determine the ability of texture analysis to identify patients who develop radiation pneumonitis (RP). Methods and Materials—A total of 106 patients who received radiation therapy (RT) for esophageal cancer were retrospectively identified under institutional review board approval. For each patient, diagnostic computed tomography (CT) scans were acquired before (0–168 days) and after (5–120 days) RT, and a treatment planning CT scan with an associated dose map was obtained. 32- × 32-pixel regions of interest (ROIs) were randomly identified in the lungs of each pre-RT scan. ROIs were subsequently mapped to the post-RT scan and the planning scan dose map by using deformable image registration. The changes in 20 feature values (∆FV) between pre- and post-RT scan ROIs were calculated. Regression modeling and analysis of variance were used to test the relationships between ∆FV, mean ROI dose, and development of grade ≥2 RP. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated to determine each feature's ability to distinguish between patients with and those without RP. A classifier was constructed to determine whether 2- or 3-feature combinations could improve RP distinction. Results—For all 20 features, a significant ∆FV was observed with increasing radiation dose. Twelve features changed significantly for patients with RP. Individual texture features could discriminate between patients with and those without RP with moderate performance (AUCs from 0.49 to 0.78). Using multiple features in a classifier, AUC increased significantly (0.59–0.84).},

Besides segmenting the gross tumor, we also differentiate between active cells, necrotic core, and edema. Our discriminative approach is based on decision forests using context-aware spatial features, and integrates a generative model of tissue appearance, by using the probabilities obtained by tissue-specific Gaussian mixture models as additional input for the forest. Our method classifies the individual tissue types simultaneously, which has the potential to simplify the classification task. The approach is computationally efficient and of low model complexity. The validation is performed on a labeled database of 40 multi-channel MR images, including DTI. We assess the effects of using DTI, and varying the amount of training data. Our segmentation results are highly accurate, and compare favorably to the state of the art.},

abstract = {Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been routinely used for the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. However, the relationship between the MRI tumor phenotypes and the underlying genetic mechanisms remains under-explored. We integrated multi-omics molecular data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) with MRI data from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) for 91 breast invasive carcinomas. Quantitative MRI phenotypes of tumors (such as tumor size, shape, margin, and blood flow kinetics) were associated with their corresponding molecular profiles (including DNA mutation, miRNA expression, protein expression, pathway gene expression and copy number variation). We found that transcriptional activities of various genetic pathways were positively associated with tumor size, blurred tumor margin, and irregular tumor shape and that miRNA expressions were associated with the tumor size and enhancement texture, but not with other types of radiomic phenotypes. We provide all the association findings as a resource for the research community (available at http://compgenome.org/Radiogenomics/). These findings pave potential paths for the discovery of genetic mechanisms regulating specific tumor phenotypes and for improving MRI techniques as potential non-invasive approaches to probe the cancer molecular status.},

METHODS: A set of 138 consecutive patients (112 males and 26 females, median age 66 years) presented with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage A to C were retrospectively studied. For a subset of these patients (106) complete information about treatment outcome, namely local control, was available. Radiomic features were computed for the clinical target volume. A total of 35 features were extracted and analyzed. Univariate analysis was used to identify clinical and radiomics significant features. Multivariate models by Cox-regression hazards model were built for local control and survival outcome. Models were evaluated by area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. For the LC analysis, two models selecting two groups of uncorrelated features were analyzes while one single model was built for the OS analysis. RESULTS: The univariate analysis lead to the identification of 15 significant radiomics features but the analysis of cross correlation showed several cross related covariates. The un-correlated variables were used to build two separate models; both resulted into a single significant radiomic covariate: model-1: energy p {\textless} 0.05, AUC of ROC 0.6659, C.I.: 0.5585-0.7732; model-2: GLNU p {\textless} 0.05, AUC 0.6396, C.I.:0.5266-0.7526. The univariate analysis for covariates significant with respect to local control resulted in 9 clinical and 13 radiomics features with multiple and complex cross-correlations. After elastic net regularization, the most significant covariates were compacity and BCLC stage, with only compacity significant to Cox model fitting (Cox model likelihood ratio test p {\textless} 0.0001, compacity p {\textless} 0.00001; AUC of the model is 0.8014 (C.I. = 0.7232-0.8797)). CONCLUSION: A robust radiomic signature, made by one single feature was finally identified. A validation phases, based on independent set of patients is scheduled to be performed to confirm the results.},

This paper presents a method to automatically segment liver and lesions in CT abdomen images using cascaded fully convolutional neural networks (CFCNs) and dense 3D conditional random fields (CRFs). We train and cascade two FCNs for a combined segmentation of the liver and its lesions. In the first step, we train a FCN to segment the liver as ROI input for a second FCN. The second FCN solely segments lesions from the predicted liver ROIs of step 1. We refine the segmentations of the CFCN using a dense 3D CRF that accounts for both spatial coherence and appearance. CFCN models were trained in a 2-fold cross-validation on the abdominal CT dataset 3DIRCAD comprising 15 hepatic tumor volumes. Our results show that CFCN-based semantic liver and lesion segmentation achieves Dice scores over 94{\%} for liver with computation times below 100s per volume. We experimentally demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method as a decision support system with a high accuracy and speed for usage in daily clinical routine.},

Multispectral histogram analysis separates suspected tumor from the rest of the intracranial region, with region analysis used in performing the final tumor labeling.

In oncology, this typically involves differentiating between tumour types and grades, or some type of discrete outcome prediction. From the viewpoint of computer-based medical decision support, this classification requires the availability of accurate diagnoses of past cases as training target examples. The availability of such labeled databases is scarce in most areas of oncology, and especially so in neuro-oncology. In such context, semi-supervised learning oriented towards classification can be a sensible data modeling choice. In this study, semi-supervised variants of Generative Topographic Mapping, a model of the manifold learning family, are applied to two neuro-oncology problems: the diagnostic discrimination between different brain tumour pathologies, and the prediction of outcomes for a specific type of aggressive brain tumours. Their performance compared favorably with those of the alternative Laplacian Eigenmaps and Semi-Supervised SVM for Manifold Learning models in most of the experiments.},

abstract = {Among brain tumors, gliomas are the most common and aggressive, leading to a very short life expectancy in their highest grade. Thus, treatment planning is a key stage to improve the quality of life of oncological patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used imaging technique to assess these tumors, but the large amount of data produced byMRI prevents manual segmentation in a reasonable time, limiting the use of precise quantitative measurements in the clinical practice. So, automatic and reliable segmentation methods are required; however, the large spatial and structural variability among brain tumors make automatic segmentation a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an automatic segmentation method based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), exploring small 3 3 kernels. The use of small kernels allows designing a deeper archi- tecture, besides having a positive effect against overfitting, given the fewer number of weights in the network.We also investigated the use of intensity normalization as a pre-processing step, which though not common in CNN-based segmentation methods, proved together with data augmentation to be very effective for brain tumor segmentation inMRI images.

abstract = {"Radiomics" refers to the extraction and analysis of large amounts of advanced quantitative imaging features with high throughput from medical images obtained with computed tomography, positron emission tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Importantly, these data are designed to be extracted from standard-of-care images, leading to a very large potential subject pool. Radiomics data are in a mineable form that can be used to build descriptive and predictive models relating image features to phenotypes or gene-protein signatures. The core hypothesis of radiomics is that these models, which can include biological or medical data, can provide valuable diagnostic, prognostic or predictive information. The radiomics enterprise can be divided into distinct processes, each with its own challenges that need to be overcome: (a) image acquisition and reconstruction, (b) image segmentation and rendering, (c) feature extraction and feature qualification and (d) databases and data sharing for eventual (e) ad hoc informatics analyses. Each of these individual processes poses unique challenges. For example, optimum protocols for image acquisition and reconstruction have to be identified and harmonized. Also, segmentations have to be robust and involve minimal operator input. Features have to be generated that robustly reflect the complexity of the individual volumes, but cannot be overly complex or redundant. Furthermore, informatics databases that allow incorporation of image features and image annotations, along with medical and genetic data, have to be generated. Finally, the statistical approaches to analyze these data have to be optimized, as radiomics is not a mature field of study. Each of these processes will be discussed in turn, as well as some of their unique challenges and proposed approaches to solve them. The focus of this article will be on images of non-small-cell lung cancer. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Aerts2014,
abstract = {Human cancers exhibit strong phenotypic differences that can be visualized noninvasively by medical imaging. Radiomics refers to the comprehensive quantification of tumour phenotypes by applying a large number of quantitative image features. Here we present a radiomic analysis of 440 features quantifying tumour image intensity, shape and texture, which are extracted from computed tomography data of 1,019 patients with lung or head-and-neck cancer. We find that a large number of radiomic features have prognostic power in independent data sets of lung and head-and-neck cancer patients, many of which were not identified as significant before. Radiogenomics analysis reveals that a prognostic radiomic signature, capturing intratumour heterogeneity, is associated with underlying gene-expression patterns. These data suggest that radiomics identifies a general prognostic phenotype existing in both lung and head-and-neck cancer. This may have a clinical impact as imaging is routinely used in clinical practice, providing an unprecedented opportunity to improve decision-support in cancer treatment at low cost.},

abstract = {The increasing use of biomarkers in cancer have led to the concept of personalized medicine for patients. Personalized medicine provides better diagnosis and treatment options available to clinicians. Radiological imaging techniques provide an opportunity to deliver unique data on different types of tissue. However, obtaining useful information from all radiological data is challenging in the era of " big data " . Recent advances in computational power and the use of genomics have generated a new area of research termed Radiomics. Radiomics is defined as the high throughput extraction of quantitative imaging features or texture (radiomics) from imaging to decode tissue pathology and creating a high dimensional data set for feature extraction. Radiomic features provide information about the gray-scale patterns, inter-pixel relationships. In addition, shape and spectral properties can be extracted within the same regions of interest on radiological images. Moreover, these features can be further used to develop computational models using advanced machine learning algorithms that may serve as a tool for personalized diagnosis and treatment guidance.},

@article{Thawani2018,
abstract = {Lung cancer is responsible for a large proportion of cancer-related deaths across the globe, with delayed detection being perhaps the most significant factor for its high mortality rate. Though the National Lung Screening Trial argues for screening of certain at-risk populations, the practical implementation of these screening efforts has not yet been successful and remains in high demand. Radiomics refers to the computerized extraction of data from radiologic images, and provides unique potential for making lung cancer screening more rapid and accurate using machine learning algorithms. The quantitative features analyzed express subvisual characteristics of images which correlate with pathogenesis of diseases. These features are broadly classified into four categories: intensity, structure, texture/gradient, and wavelet, based on the types of image attributes they capture. Many studies have been done to show correlation between these features and the malignant potential of a nodule on a chest CT. In cancer patients, these nodules also have features that can be correlated with prognosis and mutation status. The major limitations of radiomics are the lack of standardization of acquisition parameters, inconsistent radiomic methods, and lack of reproducibility. Researchers are working on overcoming these limitations, which would make radiomics more acceptable in the medical community.},

@article{Cheng2016,
abstract = {This paper performs a comprehensive study on the deep-learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) for the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant nodules/lesions by avoiding the potential errors caused by inaccurate image processing results (e.g., boundary segmentation), as well as the classification bias resulting from a less robust feature set, as involved in most conventional CADx algorithms. Specifically, the stacked denoising auto-encoder (SDAE) is exploited on the two CADx applications for the differentiation of breast ultrasound lesions and lung CT nodules. The SDAE architecture is well equipped with the automatic feature exploration mechanism and noise tolerance advantage, and hence may be suitable to deal with the intrinsically noisy property of medical image data from various imaging modalities. To show the outperformance of SDAE-based CADx over the conventional scheme, two latest conventional CADx algorithms are implemented for comparison. 10 times of 10-fold cross-validations are conducted to illustrate the efficacy of the SDAE-based CADx algorithm. The experimental results show the significant performance boost by the SDAE-based CADx algorithm over the two conventional methods, suggesting that deep learning techniques can potentially change the design paradigm of the CADx systems without the need of explicit design and selection of problem-oriented features.},

Weibull probability density function is used to analyze the wind data and the performance analysis is based on computing the capacity factors. The economic considerations involve computation of cost of energy based on the energy yield, capital cost, operation and maintenance costs and fixed charge rate of the wind turbines under study at the site. The wind site selected for the study is located at Basaveshwar Engineering College Bagalkot, Karnataka, India. Wind velocities are recorded from a 50-meter wind mast set up under the research grant received from Technical Education Quality Improvement Program of the World Bank. The period of measurement of wind velocities is from June 2007 to May 2008. Four small wind turbine generators of size 0.4 kW, 0.65 kW, 1.5 kW and 4.2 kW respectively and locally available in India are used for the study. A novel methodology to compute economic index to select economically viable wind turbine generator is derived and presented in the paper. Economic indices for the four turbines under study are computed. A detailed discussion of the results to select an economically viable wind turbine generator is presented.},

abstract = {Machine learning techniques have been widely used to support the diagnosis of neurological diseases such as dementia. Recent approaches utilize local intensity patterns within patches to derive voxelwise grading measures of disease. However, the relationships among these patches are usually ignored. In addition, there is some ambiguity in assigning disease labels to the extracted patches. Not all of the patches extracted from patients with dementia are characteristic of morphology associated with disease. In this paper, we propose to use a multiple instance learning method to address the problem of assigning training labels to the patches. In addition, a graph is built for each image to exploit the relationships among these patches, which aids the classification work. We illustrate the proposed approach in an application for the detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD): Using the baseline MR images of 834 subjects from the ADNI study, the proposed method can achieve a classification accuracy of 88.8{\%} between AD patients and healthy controls, and 69.6{\%} between patients with stable Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and progressive MCI. These results compare favourably with state-of-the-art classification methods. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show potential for computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) by learning features directly from the image data instead of using analytically extracted features. However, CNNs are difficult to train from scratch for medical images due to small sample sizes and variations in tumor presentations. Instead, transfer learning can be used to extract tumor information from medical images via CNNs originally pretrained for nonmedical tasks, alleviating the need for large datasets. Our database includes 219 breast lesions (607 full-field digital mammographic images). We compared support vector machine classifiers based on the CNN-extracted image features and our prior computer-extracted tumor features in the task of distinguishing between benign and malignant breast lesions. Five-fold cross validation (by lesion) was conducted with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve as the performance metric. Results show that classifiers based on CNN-extracted features (with transfer learning) perform comparably to those using analytically extracted features [area under the ROC curve [Formula: see text]]. Further, the performance of ensemble classifiers based on both types was significantly better than that of either classifier type alone ([Formula: see text] versus 0.81, [Formula: see text]). We conclude that transfer learning can improve current CADx methods while also providing standalone classifiers without large datasets, facilitating machine-learning methods in radiomics and precision medicine.},

Here, we applied a pretrained CNN to extract deep features from 40 computed tomography images, with contrast, of non-small cell adenocarcinoma lung cancer, and combined deep features with traditional image features and trained classifiers to predict short- and long-term survivors.

The best reported accuracy from transfer learning and deep features was 77.5{\%} (AUC, 0.713) using a decision tree classifier. When extracted deep neural network features were combined with traditional quantitative features, we obtained an accuracy of 90{\%} (AUC, 0.935) with the 5 best post-rectified linear unit features extracted from a vgg-f pretrained CNN and the 5 best traditional features.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s). Deep learning-based radiomics (DLR) was developed to extract deep information from multiple modalities of magnetic resonance (MR) images. The performance of DLR for predicting the mutation status of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) was validated in a dataset of 151 patients with low-grade glioma. A modified convolutional neural network (CNN) structure with 6 convolutional layers and a fully connected layer with 4096 neurons was used to segment tumors. Instead of calculating image features from segmented images, as typically performed for normal radiomics approaches, image features were obtained by normalizing the information of the last convolutional layers of the CNN. Fisher vector was used to encode the CNN features from image slices of different sizes. High-throughput features with dimensionality greater than 1.6∗10 4  were obtained from the CNN. Paired t-tests and F-scores were used to select CNN features that were able to discriminate IDH1. With the same dataset, the area under the operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the normal radiomics method was 86{\%} for IDH1 estimation, whereas for DLR the AUC was 92{\%}. The AUC of IDH1 estimation was further improved to 95{\%} using DLR based on multiple-modality MR images. DLR could be a powerful way to extract deep information from medical images.},

The performance of every scheme was evaluated by using a 10-fold cross-validation method and an assessment index of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The observed highest area under the curve (AUC) was 0.899±0.018 achieved by CNN, which was significantly higher than traditional CADx with the AUC=0.848±0.026. The results from DBN was also slightly higher than CADx, while SDAE was slightly lower. By visualizing the automatic generated features, we found some meaningful detectors like curvy stroke detectors from deep structured schemes. The study results showed the deep structured algorithms with automatically generated features can achieve desirable performance in lung nodule diagnosis. With well-tuned parameters and large enough dataset, the deep learning algorithms can have better performance than current popular CADx. We believe the deep learning algorithms with similar data preprocessing procedure can be used in other medical image analysis areas as well.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE. In this paper, we propose a novel method of identifying pulmonary nodules in a lung CT. Specifically, we devise a deep neural network by which we extract abstract information inherent in raw hand-crafted imaging features. We then combine the deep learned representations with the original raw imaging features into a long feature vector. By taking the combined feature vectors, we train a classifier, preceded by a feature selection via t-test. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we performed experiments on our in-house dataset of 20 subjects; 3,598 pulmonary nodules (malignant: 178, benign: 3,420), which were manually segmented by a radiologist. In our experiments, we achieved the maximal accuracy of 95.5{\%}, sensitivity of 94.4{\%}, and AUC of 0.987, outperforming the competing method.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Author(s). We sought to quantify contribution of radiomics and SUVmax at PET/CT to predict clinical outcome in lung cancer patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). 150 patients with 172 lung cancers, who underwent SBRT were retrospectively included. Radiomics were applied on PET/CT. Principal components (PC) for 42 CT and PET-derived features were examined to determine which ones accounted for most of variability. Survival analysis quantified ability of radiomics and SUVmax to predict outcome. PCs including homogeneity, size, maximum intensity, mean and median gray level, standard deviation, entropy, kurtosis, skewness, morphology and asymmetry were included in prediction models for regional control (RC) [PC4-HR:0.38, p = 0.02], distant control (DC) [PC4-HR:0.51, p = 0.02 and PC1-HR:1.12, p = 0.01], recurrence free probability (RFP) [PC1-HR:1.08, p = 0.04], disease specific survival (DSS) [PC2-HR:1.34, p = 0.03 and PC3-HR:0.64, p = 0.02] and overall survival (OS) [PC4-HR:0.45, p = 0.004 and PC3-HR:0.74, p = 0.02]. In combined analysis with SUVmax, PC1 lost predictive ability over SUVmax for RFP [HR:1.1, p = 0.04] and DC [HR:1.13, p = 0.002], while PC4 remained predictive of DC independent of SUVmax [HR:0.5, p = 0.02]. Radiomics remained the only predictors of OS, DSS and RC. Neither SUVmax nor radiomics predicted recurrence free survival. Radiomics on PET/CT provided complementary information for prediction of control and survival in SBRT-Treated lung cancer patients.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.Objective: This study aims to develop a new quantitative image feature analysis scheme and investigate its role along with two genomic biomarkers, namely protein expression of the excision repair cross-complementing 1 genes and a regulatory subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (RRM1), in predicting cancer recurrence risk of stage I nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients after surgery. Methods: By using chest computed tomography images, we developed a computer-aided detection scheme to segment lung tumors and computed tumor-related image features. After feature selection, we trained a Na{\"{i}}ve Bayesian network-based classifier using eight image features and a multilayer perceptron classifier using two genomic biomarkers to predict cancer recurrence risk, respectively. Two classifiers were trained and tested using a dataset with 79 stage I NSCLC cases, a synthetic minority oversampling technique and a leave-one-case-out validation method. A fusion method was also applied to combine prediction scores of two classifiers. Results: Areas under ROC curves (AUC) values are 0.78 ± 0.06 and 0.68 ± 0.07 when using the image feature and genomic biomarker-based classifiers, respectively. AUC value significantly increased to 0.84 ± 0.05 (p {\textless} 0.05) when fusion of two classifier-generated prediction scores using an equal weighting factor. Conclusion: A quantitative image feature-based classifier yielded significantly higher discriminatory power than a genomic biomarker-based classifier in predicting cancer recurrence risk. Fusion of prediction scores generated by the two classifiers further improved prediction performance. Significance: We demonstrated a new approach that has potential to assist clinicians in more effectively managing stage I NSCLC patients to reduce cancer recurrence risk.},

@article{Oakden-Rayner2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s). Precision medicine approaches rely on obtaining precise knowledge of the true state of health of an individual patient, which results from a combination of their genetic risks and environmental exposures. This approach is currently limited by the lack of effective and efficient non-invasive medical tests to define the full range of phenotypic variation associated with individual health. Such knowledge is critical for improved early intervention, for better treatment decisions, and for ameliorating the steadily worsening epidemic of chronic disease. We present proof-of-concept experiments to demonstrate how routinely acquired cross-sectional CT imaging may be used to predict patient longevity as a proxy for overall individual health and disease status using computer image analysis techniques. Despite the limitations of a modest dataset and the use of off-the-shelf machine learning methods, our results are comparable to previous 'manual' clinical methods for longevity prediction. This work demonstrates that radiomics techniques can be used to extract biomarkers relevant to one of the most widely used outcomes in epidemiological and clinical research - mortality, and that deep learning with convolutional neural networks can be usefully applied to radiomics research. Computer image analysis applied to routinely collected medical images offers substantial potential to enhance precision medicine initiatives.},

abstract = {There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

This paper presents a method to automatically segment liver and lesions in CT and MRI abdomen images using cascaded fully convolutional neural networks (CFCNs) enabling the segmentation of a large-scale medical trial or quantitative image analysis. We train and cascade two FCNs for a combined segmentation of the liver and its lesions. In the first step, we train a FCN to segment the liver as ROI input for a second FCN. The second FCN solely segments lesions within the predicted liver ROIs of step 1. CFCN models were trained on an abdominal CT dataset comprising 100 hepatic tumor volumes. Validations on further datasets show that CFCN-based semantic liver and lesion segmentation achieves Dice scores over 94{\%} for liver with computation times below 100s per volume. We further experimentally demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method on an 38 MRI liver tumor volumes and the public 3DIRCAD dataset.},

@article{Sun2017,
abstract = {This paper presents a novel, fully automatic approach based on a fully convolutional network (FCN) for segmenting liver tumors from CT images. Specifically, we designed a multi-channel fully convolutional network (MC-FCN) to segment liver tumors from multiphase contrast-enhanced CT images. Because each phase of contrast-enhanced data provides distinct information on pathological features, we trained one network for each phase of the CT images and fused their high-layer features together. The proposed approach was validated on CT images taken from two databases: 3Dircadb and JDRD. In the case of 3Dircadb, using the FCN, the mean ratios of the volumetric overlap error (VOE), relative volume difference (RVD), average symmetric surface distance (ASD), root mean square symmetric surface distance (RMSD) and maximum symmetric surface distance (MSSD) were 15.6 ± 4.3{\%}, 5.8 ± 3.5{\%}, 2.0 ± 0.9{\%}, 2.9 ± 1.5 mm, 7.1 ± 6.2 mm, respectively. For JDRD, using the MC-FCN, the mean ratios of VOE, RVD, ASD, RMSD, and MSSD were 8.1 ± 4.5{\%}, 1.7 ± 1.0{\%}, 1.5 ± 0.7{\%}, 2.0 ± 1.2 mm, 5.2 ± 6.4 mm, respectively. The test results demonstrate that the MC-FCN model provides greater accuracy and robustness than previous methods.},

In these cases, 3D fully annotated segmentation masks from experts are expensive to acquire, thus the dataset available for training a predictive model is usually small. To achieve the goal, we designed a novel deep convolutional neural network that incorporates auto-context elements directly into a U-net-like architecture. We used a patch-based strategy with a weighted sampling procedure in order to train on a sufficient number of samples. Furthermore, we designed a multi-resolution and multi-phase training framework to reduce the learning space and to increase the regularization of the model. Our method was tested on images from 20 patients and yielded promising results, outperforming standard neural network approaches as well as a benchmark method for liver tissue classification.},

abstract = {Objectives: Population-based data on metastatic sites and survival in site-specific metastases are lacking for lung cancer and for any cancer because most cancer registries do not record metastases. This study uses a novel population-based approach to identify metastases from both death certificates and national inpatient data to describe metastatic pathways in lung cancer patients. Materials and methods: 17,431 deceased lung cancer patients diagnosed 2002-2010 were identified from the nationwide Swedish Cancer Registry, which is based on compulsory reports. The influence of age at diagnosis, sex, and histological subtype on metastatic spread was investigated. Survival in metastatic lung cancer was assessed by histology and metastatic site. Results: The most frequent metastatic sites were the nervous system, bone, liver, respiratory system, and adrenal gland. Liver (35{\%}) and nervous system (47{\%}) metastases were common in patients with metastases from small cell lung cancer, and bone (39{\%}) and respiratory system (22{\%}) metastases in adenocarcinoma. Women (43{\%} vs. 35{\%}) and younger patients had more metastases to the nervous system. Median survival after diagnosis was 13 months for non-metastatic and five months for metastatic lung cancer. In this novel data, liver metastases conferred the worst prognosis (three months), especially for large cell histology. Bone metastases also featured poor survival, whereas survival in respiratory and nervous system metastases was better. Conclusion: Metastatic sites and survival in metastatic lung cancer is influenced by sex, histological subtype, and age at diagnosis. Liver and bone metastases signal poor survival, compared with nervous system metastases.},

It is based on results from the "MICCAI 2007 Grand Challenge" workshop, where 16 teams evaluated their algorithms on a common database. A collection of 20 clinical images with reference segmentations was provided to train and tune algorithms in advance. Participants were also allowed to use additional proprietary training data for that purpose. All teams then had to apply their methods to 10 test datasets and submit the obtained results. Employed algorithms include statistical shape models, atlas registration, level-sets, graph-cuts and rule-based systems. All results were compared to reference segmentations five error measures that highlight different aspects of segmentation accuracy. All measures were combined according to a specific scoring system relating the obtained values to human expert variability. In general, interactive methods reached higher average scores than automatic approaches and featured a better consistency of segmentation quality. However, the best automatic methods (mainly based on statistical shape models with some additional free deformation) could compete well on the majority of test images. The study provides an insight in performance of different segmentation approaches under real-world conditions and highlights achievements and limitations of current image analysis techniques.},

abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma appears frequently in patients with cirrhosis. Surveillance by biannual ultrasound is recommended for such patients because it allows diagnosis at an early stage, when effective therapies are feasible. The best candidates for resection are patients with a solitary tumour and preserved liver function. Liver transplantation benefits patients who are not good candidates for surgical resection, and the best candidates are those within Milan criteria (solitary tumour ≤5 cm or up to three nodules ≤3 cm). Image-guided ablation is the most frequently used therapeutic strategy, but its efficacy is limited by the size of the tumour and its localisation. Chemoembolisation has survival benefit in asymptomatic patients with multifocal disease without vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread. Finally, sorafenib, lenvatinib, which is non-inferior to sorafenib, and regorafenib increase survival and are the standard treatments in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. This Seminar summarises the scientific evidence that supports the current recommendations for clinical practice, and discusses the areas in which more research is needed.},

@article{Gillies2016,
abstract = {radiomics In the past decade, the field of medical image analysis has grown exponentially, with an increased number of pattern recognition tools and an increase in data set sizes. These advances have facilitated the development of processes for high-throughput extraction of quantitative features that result in the conversion of images into mineable data and the subsequent analysis of these data for decision support; this practice is termed radiomics. This is in contrast to the traditional practice of treating medical images as pictures intended solely for visual interpretation. Radiomic data contain first-, second-, and higher-order statistics. These data are combined with other patient data and are mined with sophisticated bioinformatics tools to develop models that may potentially improve diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive accuracy. Because radiomics analyses are intended to be conducted with standard of care images, it is conceivable that conversion of digital images to mineable data will eventually become routine practice. This report describes the process of radiomics, its challenges, and its potential power to facilitate better clinical decision making, particularly in the care of patients with cancer.},

@article{Scrivener2016,
abstract = {Lung cancers exhibit strong phenotypic differences that can be visualized noninvasively by medical imaging. Radiomics, a concept introduced in 2012, refers to the comprehensive quantification of tumor phenotypes by applying a large number of quantitative image features (watch the animation:  https://youtu.be/Tq980GEVP0Y  and the website  www.radiomics.org ). Here, we review the literature related to radiomics for lung cancer. We found 11 papers related to computed tomography (CT) radiomics, 3 to radiomics or texture analysis with positron emission tomography (PET) and 8 relating to PET/CT radiomics. There are two main applications of radiomics, the classification of lung nodules (diagnostic) or prognostication of established lung cancer (theragnostic). There are quite a few methodological issues in most of the reviewed papers. Only 5 studies, out of the 22, were externally validated. Overall, it is clear that radiomics offers great potential in improving diagnosis and patient stratification in lung cancer. It may also have a real clinical impact, as imaging is routinely used in clinical practice, providing an unprecedented opportunity to improve decision support in lung cancer treatment at low cost.},

@article{Zheng2018,
abstract = {BACKGROUND Radiomics is an emerging field in oncological research. In this study, we aimed at developing a radiomics score (rad-score) to estimate postoperative recurrence and survival in patients with solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS A total of 319 solitary HCC patients (training cohort: n = 212; validation cohort: n = 107) were enrolled. Radiomics features were extracted from the artery phase of preoperatively acquired computed tomography (CT) in all patients. A rad-score was generated by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) logistic model. Kaplan-Meier and Cox's hazard regression analyses were used to evaluate the prognostic significance of the rad-score. Final nomograms predicting recurrence and survival of solitary HCC patients were established based on the rad-score and clinicopathological factors. C-index and calibration statistics were used to assess the performance of nomograms. RESULTS Six potential radiomics features were selected out of 110 texture features to formulate the rad-score. Low rad-score positively correlated with aggressive tumor phenotypes, like larger tumor size and vascular invasion. Meanwhile, low rad-score was significantly associated with increased recurrence and reduced survival. In addition, multivariate analysis identified the rad-score as an independent prognostic factor (recurrence: Hazard ratio (HR): 2.472, 95{\%} confident interval (CI): 1.339-4.564, p = 0.004;survival: HR: 1.558, 95{\%}CI: 1.022-2.375, p = 0.039). Notably, the nomogram integrating rad-score had a better prognostic performance as compared with traditional staging systems. These results were further confirmed in the validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS The preoperative CT image based rad-score was an independent prognostic factor for the postoperative outcome of solitary HCC patients. This score may be complementary to the current staging system and help to stratify individualized treatments for solitary HCC patients.},

abstract = {Metastases are the most common malignant liver lesions and the most common indication for hepatic imaging. Specific characterization of liver metastases in patients with primary non-hepatic tumors is crucial to avoid unnecessary diagnostic work-up for incidental benign liver lesions. Magnetic resonance (MR) is rapidly emerging as the imaging modality of choice for detection and characterization of liver lesions due to the high specificity resulting from optimal lesion-to-liver contrast and no radiation exposure. Improvements in breath-hold T1-weighted fast spoiled gradient echo and rapid T2-weighted single shot echo-train acquisition enable imaging of the liver in a single breath-hold with high spatial resolution. Most metastases are hypo- to isointense on T1 and iso- to hyperintense on T2-weighted images. MR contrast agents provide critical tumor characterization and can be safely used in patients with iodine contrast allergy and renal failure. Other agents, including newly developing gadolinium-chelates or iron oxide agents may provide additional benefits in selected applications. The degree and nature of tumor vascularity form the basis for liver lesion characterization based on enhancement properties. Liver metastases may be hypovascular or hypervascular. Colon, lung, breast and gastric carcinomas are the most common tumors causing hypovascular liver metastases, and typically show perilesional enhancement. Neuroendocrine tumors including carcinoid and islet cell tumors, renal cell carcinoma, breast, melanoma, and thyroid carcinoma are tumors most commonly causing hypervascular hepatic metastases, which may develop early enhancement with variable degrees of washout and peripheral rim enhancement.},

abstract = {Tumors exhibit genomic and phenotypic heterogeneity, which has prognostic significance and may influence response to therapy. Imaging can quantify the spatial variation in architecture and function of individual tumors through quantifying basic biophysical parameters such as CT density or MRI signal relaxation rate; through measurements of blood flow, hypoxia, metabolism, cell death, and other phenotypic features; and through mapping the spatial distribution of biochemical pathways and cell signaling networks using PET, MRI, and other emerging molecular imaging techniques. These methods can establish whether one tumor is more or less heterogeneous than another and can identify subregions with differing biology. In this article, we review the image analysis methods currently used to quantify spatial heterogeneity within tumors. We discuss how analysis of intratumor heterogeneity can provide benefit over more simple biomarkers such as tumor size and average function. We consider how imaging methods can be integrated with genomic and pathology data, instead of being developed in isolation. Finally, we identify the challenges that must be overcome before measurements of intratumoral heterogeneity can be used routinely to guide patient care.},

abstract = {We explore noninvasive biomarkers of microvascular invasion (mVI) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using quantitative and semantic image features extracted from contrast-enhanced, triphasic computed tomography (CT). Under institutional review board approval, we selected 28 treatment-naive HCC patients who underwent surgical resection. Four radiologists independently selected and delineated tumor margins on three axial CT images and extracted computational features capturing tumor shape, image intensities, and texture. We also computed two types of "delta features," defined as the absolute difference and the ratio computed from all pairs of imaging phases for each feature. 717 arterial, portal-venous, delayed single-phase, and delta-phase features were robust against interreader variability ([Formula: see text]). An enhanced cross-validation analysis showed that combining robust single-phase and delta features in the arterial and venous phases identified mVI (AUC [Formula: see text]). Compared to a previously reported semantic feature signature (AUC 0.47 to 0.58), these features in our cohort showed only slight to moderate agreement (Cohen's kappa range: 0.03 to 0.59). Though preliminary, quantitative analysis of image features in arterial and venous phases may be potential surrogate biomarkers for mVI in HCC. Further study in a larger cohort is warranted.},

@article{Rusko2009,
abstract = {Segmentation of contrast-enhanced abdominal CT images is required by many clinical applications of computer aided diagnosis and therapy planning. The research on automated methods involves different organs among which the liver is the most emphasized. In the current clinical practice more images (at different phases) are acquired from the region of interest in case of a contrast-enhanced abdominal CT examination. The majority of the existing methods, however, use only the portal-venous image to segment the liver. This paper presents a method that automatically segments the liver by combining more phases of the contrast-enhanced CT examination. The method uses region-growing facilitated by pre- and post-processing functions, which incorporate anatomical and multi-phase information to eliminate over- and under-segmentation. Another method, which uses only the portal-venous phase to segment the liver automatically, is also presented. Both methods were evaluated using different datasets, which showed that the result of multi-phase method can be used without or after minor correction in nearly 94{\%} of the cases, and the single-phase method can provide result comparable with non-expert manual segmentation in 90{\%} of the cases. The comparison of the two methods demonstrates that automatic segmentation is more reliable when the information of more phases is combined. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Rational and Objectives: To evaluate whether addition of nonenhanced computed tomography (NECT) to intravenous contrast-enhanced (CE) abdominal CT improves detection or characterization of hypervascular liver masses. Patients were referred for initial staging or follow-up with known breast, melanoma, neuroendocrine, or thyroid cancer. Material and Methods: The literature was searched using the patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) method. Retrieved articles were critically appraised and assigned a level of evidence based on the Oxford University Centre for Evidence-based Medicine hierarchy of validity for diagnostic studies. Results: One thousand one hundred studies were reviewed; only 11 studies matched the PICO of our study and were appraised. Mostof the appraised articles were published in the 1990s using older technology and contrast delivery. The retrieved diagnostic performance for characterization of liver metastases showed sensitivity/specificity of 97{\%}/76{\%} for NECT, 97{\%}/75{\%} for arterial CT, and 98{\%}/76{\%} for portal venous phase CT in patients with breast cancer; sensitivity of 96{\%} (arterial and portal CT) versus 100{\%} (NECT, arterial and portal CT) in patients with melanoma; and sensitivity of 43{\%} (portal CT) versus 17{\%} (NECT) in patients with neuroendocrine tumor. No primary study was found for performance of different CT protocols in patients with thyroid cancer. Available evidence showed radiologists reported more conspicuous liver masses on CECT compared to NECT in patients with breast or neuroendocrine cancer. Conclusions: Based on existing evidence, NECT only adds a small incremental value to CECT for detection/characterization of hypervascular liver metastases. Addition of NECT increases patient's exposure to radiation and the number of images available for interpretation. {\textcopyright} 2014 AUR.},

@article{Banerjee2015,
abstract = {Microvascular invasion (MVI) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an independent predictor of poor outcomes subsequent to surgical resection or liver transplantation (LT); however, MVI currently cannot be adequately determined preoperatively. Radiogenomic venous invasion (RVI) is a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) biomarker of MVI derived from a 91-gene HCC "venous invasion" gene expression signature. Preoperative CECTs of 157 HCC patients who underwent surgical resection (N = 72) or LT (N = 85) between 2000 and 2009 at three institutions were evaluated for the presence or absence of RVI. RVI was assessed for its ability to predict MVI and outcomes. Interobserver agreement for scoring RVI was substantial among five radiologists (kappa = 0.705; P {\textless} 0.001). The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of RVI in predicting MVI was 89{\%}, 76{\%}, and 94{\%}, respectively. Positive RVI score was associated with lower overall survival (OS) than negative RVI score in the overall cohort (P {\textless} 0.001; 48 vs. {\textgreater}147 months), American Joint Committee on Cancer tumor-node-metastasis stage II (P {\textless} 0.001; 34 vs. {\textgreater}147 months), and in LT patients within Milan criteria (P {\textless} 0.001; 69 vs. {\textgreater}147 months). Positive RVI score also portended lower recurrence-free survival at 3 years versus negative RVI score (P = 0.001; 27{\%} vs. 62{\%}). CONCLUSION: RVI is a noninvasive radiogenomic biomarker that accurately predicts histological MVI in HCC surgical candidates. Its presence on preoperative CECT is associated with early disease recurrence and poor OS and may be useful for identifying patients less likely to derive a durable benefit from surgical treatment.},

abstract = {PURPOSE To perform a rapid review of the recent literature on radiomics and breast cancer (BC). METHODS A rapid review, a streamlined approach to systematically identify and summarize emerging studies was done (updated 27 September 2017). Clinical studies eligible for inclusion were those that evaluated BC using a radiomics approach and provided data on BC diagnosis (detection or characterization) or BC prognosis (response to therapy, morbidity, mortality), or provided data on technical challenges (software application: open source, repeatability of results). Descriptive statistics, results, and radiomics quality score (RQS) are presented. RESULTS N = 17 retrospective studies, all published after 2015, provided BC-related radiomics data on 3928 patients evaluated with a radiomics approach. Most studies were done for diagnosis and/or characterization (65{\%}, 11/17) or to aid in prognosis (41{\%}, 7/17). The mean number of radiomics features considered was 100. Mean RQS score was 11.88 ± 5.8 (maximum value 36). The RQS criteria related to validation, gold standard, potential clinical utility, cost analysis, and open science data had the lowest scores. The majority of studies n = 16/17 (94{\%}) provided correlation with histological outcomes and staging variables or biomarkers. Only 4/17 (23{\%}) studies provided evidence of correlation with genomic data. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used in most studies n = 14/17 (82{\%}); however, ultrasound (US), mammography, or positron emission tomography with 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose integrated with computed tomography (18F FDG PET/CT) was also used. Much heterogeneity was found for software usage. CONCLUSIONS The study of radiomics in BC patients is a new and emerging translational research topic. Radiomics in BC is frequently done to potentially improve diagnosis and characterization, mostly using MRI. Substantial quality limitations were found; high-quality prospective and reproducible studies are needed to further potential application.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIM: The purpose of this study was to analyze the incidence and survival in all sarcomas based on year of diagnosis, anatomical site, grade, stage, and age of patient. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was queried for the years 1975 to 2009 and included 18 registries across the United States representing 28{\%} of the national population. Incidence rates for 2005-2009 and five-year survival rates for 2000-2004 were calculated for all categories of sarcomas for multiple key variables.RESULTS: Sarcomas are rare, with most occurring in fewer than 5 per 1,000,000. The most common were leiomyosarcoma, Kaposi sarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, liposarcoma and fibrosarcoma. Survival was poorer for those with more advanced grade, stage, and age at-diagnosis. Most sarcomas affected the lower extremities, followed by the upper extremities and torso. Pelvic tumors were less common, but generally led lower survival than lesions of the extremities. CONCLUSION: The epidemiology of sarcomas varies widely by type and other variables. Incidence and survival data provide valuable information for patient counseling and may have implications in understanding the natural history of sarcoma. This study represents the most recently updated comprehensive report on all types of sarcomas in the United States.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multi-phase CT images are obtained sequentially after the injection of contrast agents so that there is a large amount of local deformation between images due to the respiratory and heart motion. Therefore, a non-rigid registration technique is required in order to establish the anatomical correspondence between the multi-phase CT images for liver CAD (computer-aided diagnosis). OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we propose the automatic detection method of hepatocellular carcinomas using the non-rigid registration method of multi-phase CT images. METHODS: Global movements between multi-phase CT images are aligned by rigid registration based on normalized mutual information. Local deformations between multi-phase CT images are modeled by non-rigid registration based on B-spline deformable model. After the registration of multi-phase CT images, hepatocellular carcinomas are automatically detected by analyzing the original and subtraction information of the registered multi-phase CT images. RESULTS: We applied our method to twenty five multi-phase CT datasets. Experimental results showed that the multi-phase CT images were accurately aligned. All of the hepatocellular carcinomas including small size ones in our 25 subjects were accurately detected using our method. CONCLUSION: We conclude that our method is useful for detecting hepatocellular carcinomas.},

abstract = {Hepatocellular death is present in almost all types of human liver disease and is used as a sensitive parameter for the detection of acute and chronic liver disease of viral, toxic, metabolic, or autoimmune origin. Clinical data and animal models suggest that hepatocyte death is the key trigger of liver disease progression, manifested by the subsequent development of inflammation, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Modes of hepatocellular death differ substantially between liver diseases. Different modes of cell death such as apoptosis, necrosis, and necroptosis trigger specific cell death responses and promote progression of liver disease through distinct mechanisms. In this review, we first discuss molecular mechanisms by which different modes of cell death, damage-associated molecular patterns, and specific cell death responses contribute to the development of liver disease. We then review the clinical relevance of cell death, focusing on biomarkers; the contribution of cell death to drug-induced, viral, and fatty liver disease and liver cancer; and evidence for cell death pathways as therapeutic targets.},

@article{Oldhafer1998,
abstract = {Background/Aims: Hepatic artery chemoembolization was introduced in the treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma waiting for liver transplantation. The rationale for this preoperatire treatment was to control tumor growth during the waiting period and to improve long-term survival. This study aimed to investigate whether preoperative chemoembolization not only induces marked tumor necrosis but also has a survival benefit. Methods: In this study 21 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent pretransplant chemoembolization (group I) were compared with 21 historical control patients (group II) without preoperative chemoembolization in a case-control study. The number of pretransplant chemoembolizations in each patient in group I varied between 1 and 5 with a mean of 2.44±1.15. In addition, six patients of this group received preoperative systemic chemotherapy. Results: Overall, there were no differences in survival between the groups with and without pretransplant chemoembolization at 1 year (60.8{\%} vs 61.5{\%}) and at 3 years (48.4{\%} vs 53.9{\%}). In group I, three patients developed unexplained severe pneumonia, leading to death very early after liver transplantation. Marked tumor necrosis ({\textgreater}50 {\%}) was found in 14 cases in group I. In 6 out of these 14 patients, total tumor necrosis was observed. Conclusion: Although preoperative chemoembolization or chemotherapy induced marked tumor necrosis, these patients showed no benefit in survival compared to historical controls, and appeared to be at higher risk of developing immediate postoperative infective complications.},

@misc{Cootes1995,
abstract = {Model-based vision is firmly established as a robust approach to recognizing and locating known rigid objects in the presence of noise, clutter, and occlusion. It is more problematic to apply model-based methods to images of objects whose appearance can vary, though a number of approaches based on the use of flexible templates have been proposed. The problem with existing methods is that they sacrifice model specificity in order to accommodate variability, thereby compromising robustness during image interpretation. We argue that a model should only be able to deform in ways characteristic of the class of objects it represents. We describe a method for building models by learning patterns of variability from a training set of correctly annotated images. These models can be used for image search in an iterative refinement algorithm analogous to that employed by Active Contour Models (Snakes). The key difference is that our Active Shape Models can only deform to fit the data in ways consistent with the training set. We show several practical examples where we have built such models and used them to locate partially occluded objects in noisy, cluttered images. {\textcopyright} 1995 Academic Press.

Our approach is based on a multi-tiered framework that is more robust against model initialization errors than existing methods, because the model's degrees of freedom are step-wise increased. We evaluated our method on a large data base of 86 CT liver scans from different vendors, protocols, varying resolution and contrast enhancement. For comparison, 50 of the scans were taken from 2 public data bases, one of it being the MICCAI'07 liver segmentation challenge data base. Evaluation shows state of the art results with an average mean surface distance between 1.3 mm and 1.85 mm compared to ground truth depending on the image resolution.

However, the performance of liver tumor segmentation methods can be considered lower than expected in both automatic and semi-automatic methods. Furthermore, it can be seen that most computer assisted detection/diagnosis systems require manual segmentation of liver and liver tumors, limiting clinical applicability of these systems.

@article{Saito2017,
abstract = {PURPOSE: Automated liver segmentation from a postmortem computed tomography (PMCT) volume is a challenging problem owing to the large deformation and intensity changes caused by severe pathology and/or postmortem changes. This paper addresses this problem by a novel segmentation algorithm using a statistical shape model (SSM) for a postmortem liver. METHODS: The location and shape parameters of a liver are directly estimated from a given volume by the proposed SSM-guided expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm without any spatial standardization that might fail owing to the large deformation and intensity changes. The estimated location and shape parameters are then used as a constraint of the subsequent fine segmentation process based on graph cuts. Algorithms with eight different SSMs were trained using 144 in vivo and 32 postmortem livers, and the segmentation algorithm was tested on 32 postmortem livers in a twofold cross validation manner. The segmentation performance is measured by the Jaccard index (JI) between the segmentation result and the true liver label. RESULTS: The average JI of the segmentation result with the best SSM was 0.8501, which was better compared with the results obtained using conventional SSMs and the results of the previous postmortem liver segmentation with statistically significant difference. CONCLUSIONS: We proposed an algorithm for automated liver segmentation from a PMCT volume, in which an SSM-guided EM algorithm estimated the location and shape parameters of a liver in a given volume accurately. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm using actual postmortem CT volumes.},

A multi step liver segmentation method is proposed by combining improved level set based method with texture analysis technique for computed tomography (CT) images in this work. The aiming of proposed algorithm is to overcome the segmentation problem which is caused by similar intensities between liver region and its neighboring tissues, also robust to the variations of shape and size within liver region. Firstly, the total variation with the L1norm (TV-L1) was used for obtaining the initial liver region, which can make the algorithm more efficient and robust. Secondly, both of global and local energy functions with the level set based method are used for extracting the liver region. Finally, the texture analysis method which is based on gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) was used for refining the liver region boundary. The experimental results on 16 clinical planning CT for radiation therapy were used for demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed method both quantitatively and qualitatively.},

@article{Wang2016,
abstract = {PURPOSE: Propose a fully automatic 3D segmentation framework to segment liver on challenging cases that contain the low contrast of adjacent organs and the presence of pathologies from abdominal CT images., METHODS: First, all of the atlases are weighted in the selected training datasets by calculating the similarities between the atlases and the test image to dynamically generate a subject-specific probabilistic atlas for the test image. The most likely liver region of the test image is further determined based on the generated atlas. A rough segmentation is obtained by a maximum a posteriori classification of probability map, and the final liver segmentation is produced by a shape-intensity prior level set in the most likely liver region. Our method is evaluated and demonstrated on 25 test CT datasets from our partner site, and its results are compared with two state-of-the-art liver segmentation methods. Moreover, our performance results on 10 MICCAI test datasets are submitted to the organizers for comparison with the other automatic algorithms., RESULTS: Using the 25 test CT datasets, average symmetric surface distance is [Formula: see text] mm (range 0.62-2.12 mm), root mean square symmetric surface distance error is [Formula: see text] mm (range 0.97-3.01 mm), and maximum symmetric surface distance error is [Formula: see text] mm (range 12.73-26.67 mm) by our method. Our method on 10 MICCAI test data sets ranks 10th in all the 47 automatic algorithms on the site as of July 2015. Quantitative results, as well as qualitative comparisons of segmentations, indicate that our method is a promising tool to improve the efficiency of both techniques., CONCLUSION: The applicability of the proposed method to some challenging clinical problems and the segmentation of the liver are demonstrated with good results on both quantitative and qualitative experimentations. This study suggests that the proposed framework can be good enough to replace the time-consuming and tedious slice-by-slice manual segmentation approach.},

In that context, level-set algorithms have achieved better results than others, especially with altered liver parenchyma or in cases with previous surgery. In order to improve functional liver parenchyma volume measurements, in this work we propose two strategies to enhance previous level-set algorithms: an optimal multi-resolution strategy with fine details correction and adaptive curvature, as well as an additional semiautomatic step imposing local curvature constraints. Results show more accurate segmentations, especially in elongated structures, detecting internal lesions and avoiding leakages to close structures.},

abstract = {Surgical planning of liver tumor resections requires detailed three-dimensional (3D) understanding of the complex arrangement of vasculature, liver segments and tumors. Knowledge about location and sizes of liver segments is important for choosing an optimal surgical resection approach and predicting postoperative residual liver capacity. The aim of this work is to facilitate such surgical planning process by developing a robust method for portal vein tree segmentation. The work also investigates the impact of vessel segmentation on the approximation of liver segment volumes. For segment approximation, smaller portal vein branches are of importance. Small branches, however, are difficult to segment due to noise and partial volume effects. Our vessel segmentation is based on the original gray-values and on the result of a vessel enhancement filter. Validation of the developed portal vein segmentation method in computer generated phantoms shows that, compared to a conventional approach, more vessel branches can be segmented. Experiments with in vivo acquired liver CT data sets confirmed this result. The outcome of a Nearest Neighbor liver segment approximation method applied to phantom data demonstrates, that the proposed vessel segmentation approach translates into a more accurate segment partitioning.},

abstract = {This study introduces a novel liver segmentation approach for estimating anatomic liver volumes towards selective internal radiation treatment (SIRT). The algorithm requires minimal human interaction since the initialization process to segment the entire liver in 3D relied on a single computed tomography (CT) slice. The algorithm integrates a localized contouring algorithm with a modified k-means method. The modified k-means segments each slice into five distinct regions belonging to different structures. The liver region is further segmented using localized contouring. The novelty of the algorithm is in the design of the initialization masks for region contouring to minimize human intervention. Intensity based region growing together with novel volume of interest (VOI) based corrections is used to accomplish the single slice initialization. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using 34 liver CT scans. Statistical experiments were performed to determine consistency of segmentation and to assess user dependency on the initialization process. Volume estimations are compared to the manual gold standard. Results show an average accuracy of 97.22{\%} for volumetric calculation with an average Dice coefficient of 0.92. Statistical tests show that the algorithm is highly consistent and independent of user initialization ( and Fleiss' ).},

@article{Shi2016,
abstract = {Motivated by the goals of improving segmentation of challenging liver cases containing low contrast with neighboring organs and presence of pathologies as well as highly varied shapes between subjects, a novel framework is presented for liver segmentation in portal phase of abdominal CT images. In a first training step, we describe a multilevel local region-based Sparse Shape Composition (SSC) model, called MLR-SSC, to increase the flexibility of shape prior models and capture the detailed local shape information more faithfully. Specifically, the liver shapes are decomposed into multiple regions in a multilevel fashion. Moreover, we build a local shape repository for each region and refine an input shape in a region-by-region manner. In a second testing step, it starts with a blood vessel-based liver shape initialization to derive a more patient-specific initial shape, followed by a hierarchical deformable shape optimization algorithm. It makes the segmentation framework more efficient and robust to local minima. Extensive experiments on 60 clinical CT scans demonstrate that our method achieves much better accuracy and efficiency than two closely related methods in the presence of small training sets. Moreover, our method shows slightly superior performance to three newly published methods. Also, we compare our method with the published semi-automatic methods from the "MICCAI 2007 Grand Challenge" workshop.},

@article{Kumar2013,
abstract = {Computed Tomography (CT) images are widely used for diagnosis of liver diseases and volume measurement for liver surgery and transplantation. Segmentation of liver and lesion is regarded as a major primary step in computer-aided diagnosis of liver diseases. Lesion alone cannot be segmented automatically from the abdominal CT image since there are tissues external to the liver with similar intensity to the lesions. Therefore, it is necessary to segment the liver first so that lesion can then be segmented accurately from it. In this paper, an approach for automatic and effective segmentation of liver and lesion from CT images needed for computer-aided diagnosis of liver is proposed. The method uses confidence connected region growing facilitated by preprocessing and postprocessing functions for automatic segmentation of liver and Alternative Fuzzy C-Means clustering for lesion segmentation. The algorithm is quantitatively evaluated by comparing automatic segmentation results to the manual segmentation results based on volume measurement error, figure of merit, spatial overlap, false positive error, false negative error, and visual overlap.  2011 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

The intensity of the tumor can be lower and or higher than that of the liver.

Tumor sometimes presents in a very small dimension and makes the detection even more difficult.

@article{Freiman2011,
abstract = {Objective We present amethod and a validation study for the nearly automatic segmentation of liver tumors in CTA scans. Materials and methods Our method inputs a liver CTA scan and a small number of user-defined seeds. It first classifies the liver voxels into tumor and healthy tissue classes with an SVM classification engine from which a new set of high- quality seeds is generated. Next, an energy function describ- ing the propagation of these seeds is defined over the 3D image. The functional consists of a set of linear equations that are optimized with the conjugate gradients method. The result is a continuous segmentation map that is thresholded to obtain a binary segmentation. Results A retrospective study on a validated clinical dataset consisting of 20 tumors from nine patients' CTA scans from the MICCAI'08 3D Liver Tumors Segmentation Challenge Workshop yielded an average aggregate score of 67, an aver- age symmetric surface distance of 1.76mm (SD=0.61mm) which is better than the 2.0mm of other methods on the same database, and a comparable volumetric overlap error (33.8 vs. 32.6{\%}). The advantage of our method is that it requires less user interaction compared to other methods. Conclusion Our results indicate that our method is accurate, efficient, and robust to wide variety of tumor types and is comparable or superior to other semi-automatic segmenta- tion methods, with much less user interaction.},

We asked four readers to outline tumors in three representative slices from each phase of multiphasic liver CT images taken from 29 patients (1128 segmentations) with hepatocellular carcinoma. Core samples were obtained by automatically tracing the maximal circle inscribed in the outlines. Image features describing the intensity, texture, shape, and margin were used to describe the segmented lesion. We calculated the intraclass correlation between the features extracted from the readers' segmentations and their core samples to characterize robustness to segmentation between readers, and between human-based segmentation and core sampling. We conclude that despite the high interreader variability in manually delineating the tumor (average overlap of 43{\%} across all readers), certain features such as intensity and texture features are robust to segmentation. More importantly, this same subset of features can be obtained from the core samples, providing as much information as detailed segmentation while being simpler and faster to obtain.},

Assessment of imaging response is essential in the management of HCC for determining efficacy of therapy and as a surrogate marker for improved survival. The established morphological image biomarkers for tumor burden measurement continue to be applied, as size measurement can easily be used in clinical practice. However, in the setting of liver-directed LRTs for HCC, simple tumor morphological changes can be less informative and usually appear later than biologic changes. Functional imaging (such as perfusion and diffusion imaging, PET-CT/MR and MR spectroscopy) has the potential to be a promising technique for assessment of HCC response to LRTs. Although promising, none of these functional imaging biomarkers have gone through all the required steps of standardization and validation and established accepted criteria for clinical practice.},

In all but one, a thermal necrosis volume greater than the tumoral nodule volume was created to obtain total tumor destruction. One large tumor was treated for debulking purposes. RESULTS. Hepatocellular carcinoma nodule destruction was achieved in a mean of 3.3 sessions of RF interstitial thermal ablation. During a mean follow-up of 22.6 months (range, 34-66 months), 16 (41{\%}) of 39 patients had recurrences; two (5{\%}) of these patients showed local recurrences and the remaining 14 (36{\%}) had new lesions. Nine of these 16 patients underwent further RF interstitial thermal ablation that proved effective. RF interstitial thermal ablation was also successfully repeated in four patients who had a second recurrence. With RF interstitial thermal ablation, we treated 54 hepatocellular carcinoma nodules in 39 patients. Eleven (28{\%}) of the 39 patients died: five from hepatic failure due to advanced cancer and six from causes other than cancer. Autopsy was performed on three patients who died from causes other than cancer, one had had two new courses of RF interstitial thermal ablation for two new lesions. Gross examination failed to detect two treated tumor nodules; histologic examination of three other treated tumor nodules showed total necrosis in two nodules and a 3-mm focus of viable cancer cells in the other nodule. Cumulative survival curves showed the median survival time to be 44 months. The survival rate for the first year was 0.94, 0.86 for the second year, 0.68 for the third year, and 0.40 for the fourth and fifth years. In the patients treated for metastatic nodules, posttreatment imaging studies showed necrosis that varied from 80{\%} to 100{\%} in all cases. Pathologic studies performed on two patients who underwent surgery after RF interstitial thermal ablation showed 100{\%} necrosis in one case and 80{\%} necrosis in the other. CONCLUSION. RF interstitial thermal ablation is a useful percutaneous treatment for hepatic cancer.},

abstract = {Background: Results from phase II studies in patients with stage IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer with ipsilateral mediastinal nodal metastases (N2) have shown the feasibility of resection after concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy with promising rates of survival. We therefore did this phase III trial to compare concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by resection with standard concurrent chemotherapy and definitive radiotherapy without resection. Methods: Patients with stage T1-3pN2M0 non-small-cell lung cancer were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to concurrent induction chemotherapy (two cycles of cisplatin [50 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 29, and 36] and etoposide [50 mg/m2 on days 1-5 and 29-33]) plus radiotherapy (45 Gy) in multiple academic and community hospitals. If no progression, patients in group 1 underwent resection and those in group 2 continued radiotherapy uninterrupted up to 61 Gy. Two additional cycles of cisplatin and etoposide were given in both groups. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00002550. Findings: 202 patients (median age 59 years, range 31-77) were assigned to group 1 and 194 (61 years, 32-78) to group 2. Median OS was 23{\textperiodcentered}6 months (IQR 9{\textperiodcentered}0-not reached) in group 1 versus 22{\textperiodcentered}2 months (9{\textperiodcentered}4-52{\textperiodcentered}7) in group 2 (hazard ratio [HR] 0{\textperiodcentered}87 [0{\textperiodcentered}70-1{\textperiodcentered}10]; p=0{\textperiodcentered}24). Number of patients alive at 5 years was 37 (point estimate 27{\%}) in group 1 and 24 (point estimate 20{\%}) in group 2 (odds ratio 0{\textperiodcentered}63 [0{\textperiodcentered}36-1{\textperiodcentered}10]; p=0{\textperiodcentered}10). With N0 status at thoracotomy, the median OS was 34{\textperiodcentered}4 months (IQR 15{\textperiodcentered}7-not reached; 19 [point estimate 41{\%}] patients alive at 5 years). Progression-free survival (PFS) was better in group 1 than in group 2, median 12{\textperiodcentered}8 months (5{\textperiodcentered}3-42{\textperiodcentered}2) vs 10{\textperiodcentered}5 months (4{\textperiodcentered}8-20{\textperiodcentered}6), HR 0{\textperiodcentered}77 [0{\textperiodcentered}62-0{\textperiodcentered}96]; p=0{\textperiodcentered}017); the number of patients without disease progression at 5 years was 32 (point estimate 22{\%}) versus 13 (point estimate 11{\%}), respectively. Neutropenia and oesophagitis were the main grade 3 or 4 toxicities associated with chemotherapy plus radiotherapy in group 1 (77 [38{\%}] and 20 [10{\%}], respectively) and group 2 (80 [41{\%}] and 44 [23{\%}], respectively). In group 1, 16 (8{\%}) deaths were treatment related versus four (2{\%}) in group 2. In an exploratory analysis, OS was improved for patients who underwent lobectomy, but not pneumonectomy, versus chemotherapy plus radiotherapy. Interpretation: Chemotherapy plus radiotherapy with or without resection (preferably lobectomy) are options for patients with stage IIIA(N2) non-small-cell lung cancer.

abstract = {Objectives: Comparison of 2-dimensional and semiautomated 3-dimensional (3D) measurements to distinguish between benign and malignant lymph nodes in patients with malignant lymphoma. Methods: Whole-body positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) was performed in 33 patients before therapy for malignant lymphoma. Two hundred fifty-seven peripheral lymph nodes (mean size, 13.4 ± 5.4 mm) were evaluated independently by 2 radiologists, both manually and with the use of semiautomated segmentation software. Long-axis diameter (LAD), short-axis diameter (SAD), maximal 3D diameter, volume, and elongation were measured. Positron emission tomography-CT and PET-CT follow-up and/or histology served as the reference standard. Statistical analysis encompassed intraclass correlation coefficients and receiver operating characteristic curves. Results: The standard of reference revealed involvement in 116 (45{\%}) of 257 lymph nodes. Manual and semiautomated LAD and SAD showed good correlation with intraclass coefficients of 0.85 and 0.72, respectively. Semiautomated prediction of malignant lymph nodes revealed the highest areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for volume (0.760; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.639-0.887) followed by SAD (0.740; 95{\%} CI, 0.616-0.862). The findings for LAD (0.722; 95{\%} CI, 0.588-0.855), maximal 3D diameter (0.697; 95{\%} CI, 0.565-0.830), and lymph node elongation (0.605; 95{\%} CI, 0.466-0.745) were significantly lower (P {\textless} 0.05). Conclusions: Volumetric lymph node analysis is significantly superior compared with established LAD in the prediction of lymph node involvement and therefore can add to the definition of peripheral lymphoma target lesions. {\textcopyright} 2010 by Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:: To compare the intra-and interobserver variability of diameter and semiautomated volume measurements of brain metastases on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) data. MATERIALS AND METHODS:: About 75 MRI staging examinations of patients with metastasized renal cell carcinoma, thyroid cancer, or malignant melanoma (mean age, 56 years; range, 40-75 years) were included. Patients had been examined with a routine MRI protocol, including a CE 3D T1-weighted MP-RAGE sequence (1-mm slice thickness). MRI data were retrospectively analyzed using the OncoTREAT segmentation system (MeVis, Bremen, Germany, version 1.6). Volume of 355 enhancing brain metastases included in the analysis as well as the largest diameter according to Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors were measured by 2 radiologists. Intra-and interobserver variability was calculated. RESULTS:: Metastases (n = 355) had a mean diameter of 12.2 mm (range, 3.4-44.3 mm) and a mean volume of 1.4 cm (range, 12-25.1 cm). With respect to interobserver variability analysis revealed broader limits of agreement for response evaluation criteria for solid tumor measurements of all lesions (range, ±27.8{\%}-±33.0{\%}; unsigned mean: 0.2{\%}-2.5{\%}) than for volume measurements (range, ±21.4{\%}-±23.3{\%}; unsigned mean, 0.1{\%}-0.3{\%}) with statistically significant differences between diameter and volume measurements (P ≤ 0.001). Limits of agreement were similar for intra-and interobserver comparisons. CONCLUSION:: Semiautomated segmentation of brain metastases on the basis of CE-MRI yielded reproducible volume measurements with a lower variability compared with linear measurements. Volumetry of contrast-enhancing brain metastases appears to be a suitable method for size determination in oncologic follow-up imaging.

abstract = {BACKGROUND. Five-year survival rates after resection of liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma are close to 25{\%}. Recurrences occur in two-thirds of the patients after surgery. Selection of patients likely to benefit from surgery remains controversial and subjective. METHODS. Data from 1568 patients with resected liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma were collected. The prognostic value of different factors was studied through uni- and multivariate analyses. A scoring system was developed including the most relevant factors. RESULTS. Two- and 5-year survival rates were 64{\%} and 28{\%}, respectively, and were affected by: age; size of largest metastasis or CEA level; stage of the primary tumor; disease free interval; number of liver nodules; and resection margin. Giving one point to each factor, the population was divided into three risk groups with different 2-year survival rates: 0-2 (79{\%}), 3-4 (60{\%}), 5-7 (43{\%}). CONCLUSIONS. A simple prognostic scoring system was proposed to evaluate the chances for cure of patients after resection of liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma. The comparison between expected survival and estimated operative risk can help determine on an objective whether surgery is worthwhile. This system needs further prospective validation.},

abstract = {Previously untreated adult patients who presented with advanced diffuse large-cell lymphoma (DLCL) at diagnosis were studied to identify possible prognostic factors. One hundred five patients were seen between 1974 and 1981; 45 patients were stage III and 60 patients were stage IV. All patients received cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and bleomycin (CHOP-Bleo). Stage III patients also received radiation therapy alternated with chemotherapy. Overall survival was 50{\%} at 5 years and 43{\%} at 8 years. Seventy-four patients achieved a complete remission (CR) and 37 are alive and disease-free with a median follow-up of 72 months. There was no difference in clinical outcome between stage III and stage IV. However, a proportional hazards model identified lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level and tumor burden, among all clinical factors studied, as independent risk factors for survival. These two factors were also important for achievement of remission and relapse-free survival. Three distinct patient risk groups were identified with 5-year survival rates of 87{\%}, 48{\%}, and 20{\%}, respectively. The measure of tumor burden proposed herein, along with LDH level, can be used for developing treatment programs, and for meaningful comparison of different treatment regimens, as well as assessment of prognosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND. The authors investigated the clinical role of tumor burden (TB) in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, relating this parameter to most of the current clinical and prognostic factors and to the best predictive multifactorial models. METHODS. The volume of TB at diagnosis was measured directly from the initial staging computed tomography scans in 351 patients who were treated on standard protocols. The mean patient age was 34.0 years ± 16.4 years. Forty-six patients had clinical Stage I disease, 201 patients had Stage II disease, 64 patients had Stage III disease, and 40 patients had Stage IV disease. There were 146 symptomatic patients. Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and time to treatment failure (TTF) were the time parameters evaluated in the multivariate analysis. Logistic regression was applied according to those who achieved or failed complete remission. RESULTS. The mean TB normalized to body surface area (rTB) was 137.8 cm 3/m2 ± 124.7 cm3/m2 (range, 1.9-694.5 cm3/m2). In multivariate analysis, rTB was the best predictor of TTF, DFS, and complete remission; the second best predictor of OS after patient age; and largely superior to all prognostic models analyzed. For the same stage and treatment, patients who were destined to clinical failure had an initial rTB 60-108{\%} higher compared with the initial rTB in patients who achieved a cure, whereas differences in drug dose intensity were not significant. CONCLUSIONS. In the current study, it was found that the rTB, as a prognostic factor, was more effective than and was independent of hitherto used factors and scores. The rTB may be a tool for evaluating the curative potential of treatment combinations, allowing physicians and patients to make better therapeutic choices earlier. {\textcopyright} 2004 American Cancer Society.},

The application provides follow-up support for oncological therapy monitoring by volumetric quantification of lung, liver and brain metastases as well as enlarged lymph nodes and assists the user by temporal registration of lesion positions. Results: With close cooperation between computer scientists and radiologists the application was tested and optimized to achieve a high degree of usability. Several clinical studies were carried out to evaluate the robustness and reproducibility of the volumetry methods.

abstract = {Purpose: Intraindividual comparison of quantitative malignant liver tumor response analysis using computed tomography. The RECIST and WHO evaluation results were compared to the volumetry results. Materials and method: Consecutive CT follow-up investigations (portal-venous phase, collimation 3 mm, increment 2 mm) of 82 patients were analyzed retrospectively. The median interval was 56 (30-455) days. The patients showed a total of 198 (median 3, range 1-5) malignant liver lesions. The evaluation was performed by 2 radiologists using the OncoTREAT software (Mevis) in consensus. The results were classified according to RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, stable disease: -30{\%} to +20{\%}) and WHO (stable: -50{\%} to +25{\%}) and compared to the volumetric analysis (stable: -65{\%} to +44{\%}). Both the continual follow-up changes and the classified results (complete and partial remission, no change and progression) were analyzed. Results: The classified RECIST and WHO results agreed with the volumetric analysis in 71/82 (87{\%}) of cases $\kappa$ RECIST = 0,699, $\kappa$ WHO = 0,741). This included different patients thus showing the agreement between the RECIST and WHO evaluations in 68/82 (83{\%}) cases ($\kappa$ = 0,656). The estimation of the relative tumor development was clearly different in all procedures. Relative tumor changes are not directly comparable because of underlying one-, two- and three-dimensional structures. Conclusion: If the tumor size is regarded as a suitable parameter of tumor development, quantifying procedures according to RECIST and WHO are of limited use. Relatively reliable tumor response evaluation can only take place by means of thin section investigation and volumetric analysis on the basis of digital image data. {\textcopyright} Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.},

abstract = {This paper presents a comparison study between 10 automatic and six interactive methods for liver segmentation from contrast-enhanced CT images. It is based on results from the "MICCAI 2007 Grand Challenge" workshop, where 16 teams evaluated their algorithms on a common database. A collection of 20 clinical images with reference segmentations was provided to train and tune algorithms in advance. Participants were also allowed to use additional proprietary training data for that purpose. All teams then had to apply their methods to 10 test datasets and submit the obtained results. Employed algorithms include statistical shape models, atlas registration, level-sets, graph-cuts and rule-based systems. All results were compared to reference segmentations five error measures that highlight different aspects of segmentation accuracy. All measures were combined according to a specific scoring system relating the obtained values to human expert variability. In general, interactive methods reached higher average scores than automatic approaches and featured a better consistency of segmentation quality. However, the best automatic methods (mainly based on statistical shape models with some additional free deformation) could compete well on the majority of test images. The study provides an insight in performance of different segmentation approaches under real-world conditions and highlights achievements and limitations of current image analysis techniques.},

abstract = {Volumetric growth assessment of pulmonary lesions is crucial to both lung cancer screening and oncological therapy monitoring. While several methods for small pulmonary nodules have previously been presented, the segmentation of larger tumors that appear frequently in oncological patients and are more likely to be complexly interconnected with lung morphology has not yet received much attention. We present a fast, automated segmentation method that is based on morphological processing and is suitable for both small and large lesions. In addition, the proposed approach addresses clinical challenges to volume assessment such as variations in imaging protocol or inspiration state by introducing a method of segmentation-based partial volume analysis (SPVA) that follows on the segmentation procedure. Accuracy and reproducibility studies were performed to evaluate the new algorithms. In vivo interobserver and InterScan studies on low-dose data from eight clinical metastasis patients revealed that clinically significant volume change can be detected reliably and with negligible computation time by the presented methods. In addition, phantom studies were conducted. Based on the segmentation performed with the proposed method, the performance of the SPVA volumetry method was compared with the conventional technique on a phantom that was scanned with different dosages and reconstructed with varying parameters. Both systematic and absolute errors were shown to be reduced substantially by the SPVA method. The method was especially successful in accounting for slice thickness and reconstruction kernel variations, where the median error was more than halved in comparison to the conventional approach. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

Our methods are based on a hybrid algorithm originally developed for lung nodules that combines a threshold-based approach with model-based morphological processing. We propose extensions that deal with particular challenges of each lesion type: lung nodules that are attached to non-convex parts of the pleura, rim-enhancing and peripheral liver metastases and lymph nodes with an extensive contact to structures of similar density. We evaluated our methods on several hundred lesions in clinical datasets and the quality of segmentations was rated by radiologists. The results were classified as acceptable or better in 81{\%} to 92{\%} of the cases for the different algorithms and readers. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {Objectives: Liver volumetry has emerged as an important tool in clinical practice. Liver volume is assessed primarily via organ segmentation of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. The goal of this paper is to provide an accessible overview of liver segmentation targeted at radiologists and other healthcare professionals. Methods: Using images from CT and MRI, this paper reviews the indications for liver segmentation, technical approaches used in segmentation software and the developing roles of liver segmentation in clinical practice. Results: Liver segmentation for volumetric assessment is indicated prior to major hepatectomy, portal vein embolisation, associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) and transplant. Segmentation software can be categorised according to amount of user input involved: manual, semi-automated and fully automated. Manual segmentation is considered the “gold standard” in clinical practice and research, but is tedious and time-consuming. Increasingly automated segmentation approaches are more robust, but may suffer from certain segmentation pitfalls. Emerging applications of segmentation include surgical planning and integration with MRI-based biomarkers. Conclusions: Liver segmentation has multiple clinical applications and is expanding in scope. Clinicians can employ semi-automated or fully automated segmentation options to more efficiently integrate volumetry into clinical practice. Teaching points: • Liver volume is assessed via organ segmentation on CT and MRI examinations. • Liver segmentation is used for volume assessment prior to major hepatic procedures. • Segmentation approaches may be categorised according to the amount of user input involved. • Emerging applications include surgical planning and integration with MRI-based biomarkers.},

Although various segmentation methods have been proposed for medical imaging, most of them generally do not perform well in segmenting the liver from CT images because of surface features of the liver and difficulty of discrimination from other adjacent organs. In this paper, we propose a new scheme for automatic segmentation of the liver in CT images. The proposed scheme is carried out on region-of-interest (ROI) blocks that include regions of the liver with high probabilities. The ROI approach saves unnecessary computational loss in finding the accurate boundary of the liver. The proposed method utilizes the composition of morphological filters with a priori knowledge, such as the general location or the approximate intensity of the liver to detect the initial boundary of the liver. Then, we make the gradient image with the weight of an initial liver boundary and segment the liver region by using an immersion-based watershed algorithm in the gradient image. Finally, a refining process is carried out to acquire a more accurate liver region.},

	abstract = {Computed tomography (CT) images have been widely used for diagnosis of liver disease and volume measurement for liver surgery or transplantation. Automatic liver segmentation and volume measurement based on the segmentation are the most essential parts in computer-aided diagnosis for liver CT as well as computer-aided surgery. However, liver segmentation, in general, has been performed by outlining the medical image manually or segmenting CT images semi-automatically because surface features of the liver and partial-volume effects make automatic discrimination from other adjacent organs or tissues very difficult. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a new approach to automatic segmentation of the liver for volume measurement in sequential CT images. Our method analyzes the intensity distribution of several abdominal CT samples and exploits a priori knowledge, such as CT numbers and location of the liver to identify coherent regions that correspond to the liver. The proposed scheme utilizes recursively morphological filter with region-labeling and clustering to detect the search range and to generate the initial liver contour. In this search range, we deform liver contour using the labeling-based search algorithm following pattern features of the liver contour. Lastly, volume measurement is automatically performed on the segmented liver regions. The experimental measurement of area and volume is compared with those using manual tracing method as a gold standard by the radiological doctors, and demonstrates that this algorithm is effective for automatic segmentation and volume measurement method of the liver. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Lee2003,
	abstract = {Identifying abdominal organs is one of the essential steps in visualizing organ structure to assist in teaching, clinical training, diagnosis, and medical image retrieval. However, due to partial volume effects, gray-level similarities of adjacent organs, contrast media affect, and the relatively high variations of organ position and shape, automatically identifying abdominal organs has always been a high challenging task. To conquer these difficulties, this paper proposes combining a multimodule contextual neural network and spatial fuzzy rules and fuzzy descriptors for automatically identifying abdominal organs from a series of CT image slices. The multimodule contextual neural network segments each image slice through a divide-and-conquer concept, embedded within multiple neural network modules, where the results obtained from each module are forwarded to other modules for integration, in which contextual constraints are enforced. With this approach, the difficulties arising from partial volume effects, gray-level similarities of adjacent organs, and contrast media affect can be reduced to the extreme. To address the issue of high variations in organ position and shape, spatial fuzzy rules and fuzzy descriptors are adopted, along with a contour modification scheme implementing consecutive organ region overlap constraints. This approach has been tested on 40 sets of abdominal CT images, where each set consists of about 40 image slices. We have found that 99{\%} of the organ regions in the test images are correctly identified as its belonging organs, implying the high promise of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {Accurate liver segmentation on computed tomography (CT) images is a challenging task especially at sites where surrounding tissues (e.g., stomach, kidney) have densities similar to that of the liver and lesions reside at the liver edges. We have developed a method for semiautomatic delineation of the liver contours on contrast-enhanced CT images. The method utilizes a snake algorithm with a gradient vector flow (GVF) field as its external force. To improve the performance of the GVF snake in the segmentation of the liver contour, an edge map was obtained with a Canny edge detector, followed by modifications using a liver template and a concavity removal algorithm. With the modified edge map, for which unwanted edges inside the liver were eliminated, the GVF field was computed and an initial liver contour was formed. The snake algorithm was then applied to obtain the actual liver contour. This algorithm was extended to segment the liver volume in a slice-by-slice fashion, where the result of the preceding slice constrained the segmentation of the adjacent slice. 551 two-dimensional liver images from 20 volumetric images with colorectal metastases spreading throughout the livers were delineated using this method, and also manually by a radiologist for evaluation. The difference ratio, which is defined as the percentage ratio of mismatching volume between the computer and the radiologist's results, ranged from 2.9{\%} to 7.6{\%} with a median value of 5.3{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we proposed a liver extracting procedure for computer aided liver diagnosis system. An extraction of liver region is difficult due to interferences of other organs in the abdominal CT image. For this reason, liver region is extracted in ROI. ROI is selected by using the window for measuring the distribution of liver region's Hounsfield Unit in abdominal CT image. The distribution is measured by using an existential probability of liver's value in the window. If the probability of any window exceeded 50{\%}, it would be assigned to ROI. Actually, liver region is not clearly discerned from the adjacent organs as muscle, spleen, and pancreas in abdominal CT image. Liver region is extracted by the watershed segmentation algorithm which is effective in this situation. This segmentation algorithm is very sensitive to the slight variance of contrast. So it generally produces over-segmentation regions. For optimal segmentation these regions are required to merge into the significant regions. Finally, a liver region is selected and extracted by prior information based on anatomic information.},

	abstract = {Interaction increases flexibility of segmentation but it leads to undesirable behavior of an algorithm if knowledge being requested is inappropriate. In region growing, this is the case for defining the homogeneity criterion, as its specification depends also on image formation properties that are not known to the user. We developed a region growing algorithm that learns its homogeneity criterion automatically from characteristics of the region to be segmented. The method is based on a model that describes homogeneity and simple shape properties of the region. Parameters of the homogeneity criterion are estimated from sample locations in the region. These locations are selected sequentially in a random walk starting at the seed point, and the homogeneity criterion is updated continuously. This approach was extended to a fully automatic and complete segmentation method by using the pixels with the smallest gradient length in the not yet segmented image region as a seed point. The methods were tested for segmentation on test images and of structures in CT and MR images. We found the methods to work reliable if the model assumption on homogeneity and region characteristics are true. Furthermore, the model is simple but robust, thus allowing for a certain degree of deviation from model constraints and still delivering the expected segmentation result.},

The evolving contours naturally split and merge, allowing the simultaneous detection of several objects and both interior and exterior boundaries. The proposed approach is based on the relation between active contours and the computation of geodesics or minimal distance curves. The minimal distance curve lays in a Riemannian space whose metric is defined by the image content. This geodesic approach for object segmentation allows to connect classical "snakes" based on energy minimization and geometric active contours based on the theory of curve evolution. Previous models of geometric active contours are improved, allowing stable boundary detection when their gradients suffer from large variations, including gaps. Formal results concerning existence, uniqueness, stability, and correctness of the evolution are presented as well. The scheme was implemented using an efficient algorithm for curve evolution. Experimental results of applying the scheme to real images including objects with holes and medical data imagery demonstrate its power. The results may be extended to 3D object segmentation as well.},

This paper presents a level set technique for the automatic segmentation of the liver in abdominal CT scans. The main difficulty with level set methods is the design of appropriate speed functions for particular applications. Here we propose a novel speed function that is designed to (1) stop the propagating front at organ boundaries with weak edges, and (2) incorporate a-priori information on the relative position of the liver and other structures. We show that the new speed function we have designed to stop the front a weak edges is superior to other approaches proposed in the literature both on simulated images and on CT images.

	abstract = {Abstract. This paper describes an automatic liver segmentation method from three dimensional abdominal X-ray CT images. Our method extracts liver regions based on the following two steps: (1) rough extraction based on maximum a posterior probability (MAP) estimation, and (2) precise segmentation using level set method. In the former process, the segmentation can be performed more accurately by using a combination of the probability density function approximated by the extended gaussian mixture distribution and a prior probability derived from a probabilistic atlas of liver. In the latter process, we introduce a novel term to prevent the level set method from extracting muscles as a part of the liver incorrectly. From the experimental results using ten test datasets distributed for the competition, it was confirmed that our method segmented the liver regions with volumetric overlap of about 88{\%}. 1},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose an efficient semi-automatic liver segmentationmethod from contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) images. We exploit level-set speed images to define an approximate ini- tial liver shape. The first step divides a CT image into a set of discrete objects based on the gradient information, which is normalized on the speed image. The second step detects the objects belonging to the liver based on 2.5D shape propagation, which models the segmented liver re- gion of the slice immediately above or below the current slice by points being narrow-band of distance from the boundary, and skeletons. In this step, manual inputs of seed points for the topmost slice, the bottommost slice of the liver, and regions that do not connect to the liver from the previous slice are required because there is no prior information for the 2.5D shape propagation.With this optimal estimation of the initial liver shape, our method decreases the computation time by minimizing level- set propagation, which converges at the optimal position within a fixed iteration number. Our method was validated on ten data sets and the results were compared with the manually segmented result. The average score using the comparison metrics for the accuracy evaluation was 75. The average processing time for segmenting one data set was 382s.},

This paper presents a new method and corresponding algorithm for fast segmentation of the liver and its internal lesions from CT scans. No interaction between the user and analysis system is required for initialization since the algorithm is fully automatic. A statistical model-based approach was created to distinguish hepatic tissue from other abdominal organs. It was combined to an active contour technique using gradient vector flow in order to obtain a smoother and more natural liver surface segmentation. Thereafter, automatic classification was performed to isolate hepatic lesions from liver parenchyma. Twenty-one datasets, presenting different anatomical and pathological situations, have been processed and analyzed. Special focus has been driven to the resulting processing time together with quality assessment. Our method allowed robust and efficient liver and lesion segmentations very close to the ground truth, in a relatively short processing time (average of 11.4 s for a 512×512-pixel slice). A volume overlap of 94.2{\%} and an accuracy of 3.7 mm were achieved for liver surface segmentation.

This form of composite construction is so far limited to simple beam-column connections. Although the concept of semi-rigid composite joints has been widely research in the past, most of the researches have been carried out on composite joints with metal deck flooring and solid concrete slabs. Research on composite joints with precast hollowcore slabs is rather limited. As the construction industry demands for rapid construction with reduction in cost and environmental impacts, this form of composite floor system, which does not require major onsite concreting, has become very popular among the designers and engineers in the UK. In this paper, full-scale tests of beam-to-column semi-rigid composite joints with steel beam and precast hollowcore slabs are reported. Based on the tests data; the structural behaviour of these semi-rigid composite joints is discussed together with numerical and finite element modelling. Through parametric studies, an analytical model for the semirigid composite joints is proposed and is verified by both the experimental data and finite element model; and good agreement is obtained.},

@article{Suzuki2010,
	abstract = {Purpose: Computerized liver extraction from hepatic CT images is challenging because the liver often abuts other organs of a similar density. The purpose of this study was to develop a computer-aided measurement of liver volumes in hepatic CT. Methods: The authors developed a computerized liver extraction scheme based on geodesic active contour segmentation coupled with level-set contour evolution. First, an anisotropic diffusion filter was applied to portal-venous-phase CT images for noise reduction while preserving the liver structure, followed by a scale-specific gradient magnitude filter to enhance the liver boundaries. Then, a nonlinear grayscale converter enhanced the contrast of the liver parenchyma. By using the liver-parenchyma-enhanced image as a speed function, a fast-marching level-set algorithm generated an initial contour that roughly estimated the liver shape. A geodesic active contour segmentation algorithm coupled with level-set contour evolution refined the initial contour to define the liver boundaries more precisely. The liver volume was then calculated using these refined boundaries. Hepatic CT scans of 15 prospective liver donors were obtained under a liver transplant protocol with a multidetector CT system. The liver volumes extracted by the computerized scheme were compared to those traced manually by a radiologist, used as "gold standard." Results: The mean liver volume obtained with our scheme was 1504 cc, whereas the mean gold standard manual volume was 1457 cc, resulting in a mean absolute difference of 105 cc (7.2{\%}). The computer-estimated liver volumetrics agreed excellently with the gold-standard manual volumetrics (intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.95) with no statistically significant difference (F=0.77; p (Ff) =0.32). The average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and percent volume error were 98.4{\%}, 91.1{\%}, 99.1{\%}, and 7.2{\%}, respectively. Computerized CT liver volumetry would require substantially less completion time (compared to an average of 39 min per case by manual segmentation). Conclusions: The computerized liver extraction scheme provides an efficient and accurate way of measuring liver volumes in CT. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

The major restriction is that the energy function's smoothness term must only involve pairs of pixels.

The first move we consider is an $\alpha$$\beta$swap: for a pair of labels $\alpha$, $\beta$, this move exchanges the labels between an arbitrary set of pixels labeled $\alpha$ and another arbitrary set labeled $\beta$. Our first algorithm generates a labeling such that there is no swap move that decreases the energy. The second move we consider is an $\alpha$expansion: for a label $\alpha$, this move assigns an arbitrary set of pixels the label $\alpha$. Our second algorithm, which requires the smoothness term to be a metric, generates a labeling such that there is no expansion move that decreases the energy. Moreover, this solution is within a known factor of the global minimum. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on image restoration, stereo and motion.},

	abstract = {Random walks-based (RW) segmentation methods have been proven to have a potential application in segmenting the medical image with minimal interactive guidance. However, the approach leads to large-scale graphs due to number of nodes equal to voxel number. Also, segmentation is inaccurate because of the unavailability of appropriate initial seed points. It is a challenge to use the RW-based segmentation algorithm to segment organ regions from 3D medical images interactively. In this paper, a knowledge-based segmentation framework for multiple organs is proposed based on random walks. This method employs the previous segmented slice as prior knowledge (the shape and intensity constraints) for automatic segmentation of other slices, which can reduce the graph scale and significantly speed up the optimization procedure of the graph. To assess the efficiency of our proposed method, experiments were performed on liver tissues, spleen tissues and hepatic cancer and it was extensively evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively. Comparing our method with conventional RW and state-of-the-art interactive segmentation methods, our results show an improvement in the accuracy for multi-organ segmentation (p {\textless} 0.001).},

We propose the construction of probabilistic atlases which retain structural variability by using a size-preserving modified affine registration.

In this paper, a liver probabilistic atlas is constructed and exploited to automatically segment liver volumes from abdominal CT data. The atlas is aligned with the patient data through a succession of affine and non-linear registrations. The overlap and correlation with manual segmentations are 0.91 (0.93 DICE coefficient) and 0.99 respectively. Little work has taken place on the integration of volumetric measures of liver abnormality to clinical evaluations, which rely on linear estimates of liver height. Our application measures the liver height at the mid-hepatic line (0.94 correlation with manual measurements) and indicates that its combination with volumetric estimates could assist the development of a noninvasive tool to assess hepatomegaly. {\textcopyright} 2009 SPIE.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an automatic approach for segmentation of the liver from computer tomography (CT) images based on a 3D statistical shape model. Segmentation of the liver is an important prerequisite in liver surgery planning. One of the major challenges in building a 3D shape model from a training set of segmented instances of an object is the determination of the correspondence between different surfaces. We propose to use a geometric approach that is based on minimizing the distortion of the correspondence mapping between two different surfaces. For the adaption of the shape model to the image data a profile model based on the grey value appearance of the liver and its surrounding tissues in contrast enhanced CT data was developed. The robustness of this method results from a previous nonlinear diffusion filtering of the image data. Special focus is turned to the quantitative evaluation of the segmentation process. Several different error measures are discussed and implemented in a study involving more than 30 livers.},

Core of the algorithm is a statistical shape model (SSM) of the structure of interest. A global search with an evolutionary algorithm is employed to detect suitable initial parameters for the model, which are subsequently optimized by a local search similar to the Active Shape mechanism. After that, a deformable mesh with the same topology as the SSM is used for the final segmentation: While external forces strive to maximize the posterior probability of the mesh given the local appearance around the boundary, internal forces governed by tension and rigidity terms keep the shape similar to the underlying SSM. To prevent outliers and increase robustness, we determine the applied external forces by an algorithm for optimal surface detection with smoothness constraints. The approach is evaluated on 54 CT images of the liver and reaches an average surface distance of 1.6 ± 0.5 mm in comparison to manual reference segmentations. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

Three key ingredients are combined to solve the segmentation problem. First, a hierarchical framework is used to efficiently and effectively monitor the accuracy propagation in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Second, two new learning techniques, marginal space learning and steerable features, are applied for robust boundary inference. This enables handling of highly heterogeneous texture pattern. Third, a novel shape space initialization is proposed to improve traditional methods that are limited to similarity transformation.

The complexity of cardiac anatomy, poor contrast, noise or motion artifacts makes this segmentation problem a challenging task. In this paper, we present an efficient, robust, and fully automatic segmentation method for 3D cardiac computed tomography (CT) volumes. Our approach is based on recent advances in learning discriminative object models and we exploit a large database of annotated CT volumes. We formulate the segmentation as a two step learning problem: anatomical structure localization and boundary delineation. A novel algorithm, Marginal Space Learning (MSL), is introduced to solve the 9-dimensional similarity search problem for localizing the heart chambers. MSL reduces the number of testing hypotheses by about six orders of magnitude. We also propose to use steerable image features, which incorporate the orientation and scale information into the distribution of sampling points, thus avoiding the time-consuming volume data rotation operations. After determining the similarity transformation of the heart chambers, we estimate the 3D shape through learning-based boundary delineation. Extensive experiments on multi-chamber heart segmentation demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach, comparing favorably to the state-of-the-art. This is the first study reporting stable results on a large cardiac CT dataset with 323 volumes. In addition, we achieve a speed of less than eight seconds for automatic segmentation of all four chambers. {\textcopyright}2007 IEEE.},

@article{Okada2008,
	abstract = {Rationale and Objectives: An atlas-based automated liver segmentation method from three-dimensional computed tomographic (3D CT) images has been developed. The method uses two types of atlases, a probabilistic atlas (PA) and a statistical shape model (SSM). Materials and Methods: Voxel-based segmentation with a PA is first performed to obtain a liver region, then the obtained region is used as the initial region for subsequent SSM fitting to 3D CT images. To improve reconstruction accuracy, particularly for highly deformed livers, we use a multilevel SSM (ML-SSM). In ML-SSM, the entire shape is divided into patches, with principal component analysis applied to each patch. To avoid inconsistency among patches, we introduce a new constraint called the "adhesiveness constraint" for overlapping regions among patches. Results: The PA and ML-SSM were constructed from 20 training datasets. We applied the proposed method to eight evaluation datasets. On average, volumetric overlap of 89.2 ± 1.4{\%} and average distance of 1.36 ± 0.19 mm were obtained. Conclusions: The proposed method was shown to improve segmentation accuracy for datasets including highly deformed livers. We demonstrated that segmentation accuracy is improved using the initial region obtained with PA and the introduced constraint for ML-SSM. {\textcopyright} 2008 AUR.},

The training data set is obtained from one of the given set of images by creating gray level histograms for the three categories. The histograms are considered as the respective feature values. Prior to NN classification, preprocessing is employed to locally enhance the contrast of the region of interest.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop a system for automatic segmentation of the liver from computed tomographic (CT) scans of the abdomen for three-dimensional volume-rendering displays. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An automated liver segmentation system was developed, which combined domain knowledge with analysis of a global histogram, morphologic operators, and the parametrically deformable contour model. Boundaries of the thresholded liver volume were modified section-by-section by exploiting information from adjacent sections. These boundaries were refined by optimization of the parametrically deformable contour model. Volume-rendered images were created by using the boundaries to exclude tissues outside the liver. The system was tested on CT data sets from 10 cases of potentially resectable hepatic neoplasm. RESULTS: Of the 401 sections in the 10 cases, 53 sections (13.2{\%}) required user modifications during segmentation. The utility of the three-dimensional- rendered images with use of these liver boundaries was judged by a radiologist as being comparable to that of three-dimensional images created with manual editing. Twenty-eight of the sections were deemed imperfect by the radiologist and might need further modifications. CONCLUSION: An effective technique for automatic segmentation of the liver from CT images has been developed. This technique promises to save time and simplify the creation of three-dimensional liver images by minimizing operator intervention.},

Model-based liver segmentation suffers from the large shape variability of this organ, and from structures of similar appearance that juxtapose the liver. The technique presented in this paper is devoted to combine a statistical analysis of the data with a reconstruction model from sparse information: only the most reliable information in the image is used, and the rest of the liver's shape is inferred from the model and the sparse observation. The resulting process is more efficient than standard segmentation since most of the workload is concentrated on the critical points, but also more robust, since the interpolated volume is consistent with the prior knowledge statistics. The experimental results on liver dataseis prove the sparse information model has the same potential as PCA, if not better, to represent the shape of the liver. Furthermore, the performance assessment from measurement statistics on the liver's volume, distance between reconstructed surfaces and ground truth, and inter-observer variability demonstrates the liver is efficiently segmented using sparse information. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

The proposed method relies on abdominal blood vessels (ABV) to segment the liver considering the potential presence of tumors through the portal phase of a CT dataset. ABV are extracted and classified into hepatic (HBV) and nonhepatic (non-HBV) with a small number of interactions. HBV and non-HBV are used to guide an automatic segmentation of the liver. HBV are used to individually segment the core region of the liver. This region and non-HBV are used to construct a boundary surface between the liver and other organs to separate them. The core region is classified based on extracted posterior distributions of its histogram into low intensity tumor (LIT) and non-LIT core regions. Non-LIT case includes normal part of liver, HBV, and high intensity tumors if exist. Each core region is extended based on its corresponding posterior distribution. Extension is completed when it reaches either a variation in intensity or the constructed boundary surface. The method was applied to 80 datasets (30 Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) and 50 non-MICCAI data) including 60 datasets with tumors. Our results for the MICCAI-test data were evaluated by sliver07 [1] with an overall score of 79.7, which ranks seventh best on the site (December 2013).

The aiming of proposed algorithm is to overcome the segmentation problem which is caused by similar intensities between liver region and its neighboring tissues, also robust to the variations of shape and size within liver region. Firstly, the total variation with the L1norm (TV-L1) was used for obtaining the initial liver region, which can make the algorithm more efficient and robust. Secondly, both of global and local energy functions with the level set based method are used for extracting the liver region. Finally, the texture analysis method which is based on gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) was used for refining the liver region boundary. The experimental results on 16 clinical planning CT for radiation therapy were used for demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed method both quantitatively and qualitatively.},

In our algorithm, ABC calculates the centroids of clusters in the image together with the region corresponding to each cluster. Using mathematical morphological operations, we then remove small and thin regions, which may represents flesh regions around the liver area, sharp edges of organs or small lesions inside the liver. The extracted regions are integrated to give an initial estimate of the liver area. In a final step, this is further enhanced using a region growing approach.

@article{Xu2015,
	abstract = {Background: Diagnosis requires that clinicians communicate and share patient information in an efficient manner. Advances in electronic health records (EHR) and health information technologies have created both challenges and opportunities for such communication. Methods: We conducted a multi-method, focused ethnographic study of physicians on general medicine inpatient units in two teaching hospitals. Physician teams were observed during and after morning rounds to understand workflow, data sharing and communication during diagnosis. To validate findings, interviews and focus groups were conducted with physicians. Field notes and interview/focus group transcripts were reviewed and themes identified using content analysis. Results: Existing communication technologies and EHR-based data sharing processes were perceived as barriers to diagnosis. In particular, reliance on paging systems and lack of face-to- face communication among clinicians created obstacles to sustained thinking and discussion of diagnostic decision-making. Further, the EHR created data overload and data fragmentation, making integration for diagnosis difficult. To improve diagnosis, physicians recommended replacing pagers with two-way communication devices, restructuring the EHR to facilitate access to key information, and improving training on EHR systems. Conclusions: As advances in health information technology evolve, challenges in the way clinicians share information during the diagnostic process will rise. To improve diagnosis, changes to both the technology and the way in which we use it may be necessary.},

@article{Wang2015b,
	abstract = {Shape prior plays an important role in accurate and robust liver segmentation. However, liver shapes have complex variations and accurate modeling of liver shapes is challenging. Using large-scale training data can improve the accuracy but it limits the computational efficiency. In order to obtain accurate liver shape priors without sacrificing the efficiency when dealing with large-scale training data, we investigate effective and scalable shape prior modeling method that is more applicable in clinical liver surgical planning system. We employed the Sparse Shape Composition (SSC) to represent liver shapes by an optimized sparse combination of shapes in the repository, without any assumptions on parametric distributions of liver shapes. To leverage large-scale training data and improve the computational efficiency of SSC, we also introduced a homotopy-based method to quickly solve the L1-norm optimization problem in SSC. This method takes advantage of the sparsity of shape modeling, and solves the original optimization problem in SSC by continuously transforming it into a series of simplified problems whose solution is fast to compute. When new training shapes arrive gradually, the homotopy strategy updates the optimal solution on the fly and avoids re-computing it from scratch.Experiments showed that SSC had a high accuracy and efficiency in dealing with complex liver shape variations, excluding gross errors and preserving local details on the input liver shape. The homotopy-based SSC had a high computational efficiency, and its runtime increased very slowly when repository's capacity and vertex number rose to a large degree. When repository's capacity was 10,000, with 2000 vertices on each shape, homotopy method cost merely about 11.29s to solve the optimization problem in SSC, nearly 2000 times faster than interior point method. The dice similarity coefficient (DSC), average symmetric surface distance (ASD), and maximum symmetric surface distance measurement was 94.31 ± 3.04{\%}, 1.12 ± 0.69. mm and 3.65 ± 1.40. mm respectively.},

@article{Suzuki2017,
	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Japanese Society of Radiological Technology and Japan Society of Medical Physics. The use of machine learning (ML) has been increasing rapidly in the medical imaging field, including computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), radiomics, and medical image analysis. Recently, an ML area called deep learning emerged in the computer vision field and became very popular in many fields. It started from an event in late 2012, when a deep-learning approach based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) won an overwhelming victory in the best-known worldwide computer vision competition, ImageNet Classification. Since then, researchers in virtually all fields, including medical imaging, have started actively participating in the explosively growing field of deep learning. In this paper, the area of deep learning in medical imaging is overviewed, including (1) what was changed in machine learning before and after the introduction of deep learning, (2) what is the source of the power of deep learning, (3) two major deep-learning models: a massive-training artificial neural network (MTANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN), (4) similarities and differences between the two models, and (5) their applications to medical imaging. This review shows that ML with feature input (or feature-based ML) was dominant before the introduction of deep learning, and that the major and essential difference between ML before and after deep learning is the learning of image data directly without object segmentation or feature extraction; thus, it is the source of the power of deep learning, although the depth of the model is an important attribute. The class of ML with image input (or image-based ML) including deep learning has a long history, but recently gained popularity due to the use of the new terminology, deep learning. There are two major models in this class of ML in medical imaging, MTANN and CNN, which have similarities as well as several differences. In our experience, MTANNs were substantially more efficient in their development, had a higher performance, and required a lesser number of training cases than did CNNs. “Deep learning”, or ML with image input, in medical imaging is an explosively growing, promising field. It is expected that ML with image input will be the mainstream area in the field of medical imaging in the next few decades.},

@article{Bellver2017,
	abstract = {A fully automatic technique for segmenting the liver and localizing its unhealthy tissues is a convenient tool in order to diagnose hepatic diseases and assess the response to the according treatments. In this work we propose a method to segment the liver and its lesions from Computed Tomography (CT) scans using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), that have proven good results in a variety of computer vision tasks, including medical imaging. The network that segments the lesions consists of a cascaded architecture, which first focuses on the region of the liver in order to segment the lesions on it. Moreover, we train a detector to localize the lesions, and mask the results of the segmentation network with the positive detections. The segmentation architecture is based on DRIU, a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) with side outputs that work on feature maps of different resolutions, to finally benefit from the multi-scale information learned by different stages of the network. The main contribution of this work is the use of a detector to localize the lesions, which we show to be beneficial to remove false positives triggered by the segmentation network.

At last, the segmented liver region, which is enhanced by histogram equalization, is employed as an additional input to the third CDNN for tumor segmentation. Jaccard distance is used as loss function when training CDNN models to eliminate the need of sample re-weighting. Our framework is trained using the 130 challenge training cases provided by LiTS.

	abstract = {Automatic segmentation of liver lesions is a fundamental requirement towards the creation of computer aided diagnosis (CAD) and decision support systems (CDS). Traditional segmentation approaches depend heavily upon hand-crafted features and a priori knowledge of the user. As such, these methods are difficult to adopt within a clinical environment. Recently, deep learning methods based on fully convolutional networks (FCNs) have been successful in many segmentation problems primarily because they leverage a large labelled dataset to hierarchically learn the features that best correspond to the shallow visual appearance as well as the deep semantics of the areas to be segmented. However, FCNs based on a 16 layer VGGNet architecture have limited capacity to add additional layers. Therefore, it is challenging to learn more discriminative features among different classes for FCNs. In this study, we overcome these limitations using deep residual networks (ResNet) to segment liver lesions. ResNet contain skip connections between convolutional layers, which solved the problem of the training degradation of training accuracy in very deep networks and thereby enables the use of additional layers for learning more discriminative features. In addition, we achieve more precise boundary definitions through a novel cascaded ResNet architecture with multi-scale fusion to gradually learn and infer the boundaries of both the liver and the liver lesions.

On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity.

@article{Huang2017,
	abstract = {Recent work has shown that convolutional networks can be substantially deeper, more accurate, and efficient to train if they contain shorter connections between layers close to the input and those close to the output. In this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce the Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections - one between each layer and its subsequent layer - our network has L(L+1)/2 direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters. We evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet). DenseNets obtain significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on most of them, whilst requiring less computation to achieve high performance.

	abstract = {Liver tumors segmentation from computed tomography (CT) images is an essential task for diag-nosis and treatments of liver cancer. However, it is difficult owing to the variability of appearances, fuzzy boundaries, heterogeneous densities, shapes and sizes of lesions. In this paper, an automatic method based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is presented to segment lesions from CT images. The CNNs is one of deep learning models with some convolutional filters which can learn hierarchical features from data. We compared the CNNs model to popular machine learning algo-rithms: AdaBoost, Random Forests (RF), and support vector machine (SVM). These classifiers were trained by handcrafted features containing mean, variance, and contextual features. Experimental evaluation was performed on 30 portal phase enhanced CT images using leave-one-out cross vali-dation. The average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), precision, and recall achieved of 80.06{\%} ± 1.63{\%}, 82.67{\%} ± 1.43{\%}, and 84.34{\%} ± 1.61{\%}, respectively.

@article{Jin2018,
	abstract = {Automatic extraction of liver and tumor from CT volumes is a challenging task due to their heterogeneous and diffusive shapes. Recently, 2D and 3D deep convolutional neural networks have become popular in medical image segmentation tasks because of the utilization of large labeled datasets to learn hierarchical features. However, 3D networks have some drawbacks due to their high cost on computational resources. In this paper, we propose a 3D hybrid residual attention-aware segmentation method, named RA-UNet, to precisely extract the liver volume of interests (VOI) and segment tumors from the liver VOI. The proposed network has a basic architecture as a 3D U-Net which extracts contextual information combining low-level feature maps with high-level ones. Attention modules are stacked so that the attention-aware features change adaptively as the network goes "very deep" and this is made possible by residual learning. This is the first work that an attention residual mechanism is used to process medical volumetric images. We evaluated our framework on the public MICCAI 2017 Liver Tumor Segmentation dataset and the 3DIRCADb dataset. The results show that our architecture outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. We also extend our RA-UNet to brain tumor segmentation on the BraTS2018 and BraTS2017 datasets, and the results indicate that RA-UNet achieves good performance on a brain tumor segmentation task as well.},

Inside each Attention Module, bottom-up top-down feedforward structure is used to unfold the feedforward and feedback attention process into a single feedforward process. Importantly, we propose attention residual learning to train very deep Residual Attention Networks which can be easily scaled up to hundreds of layers.

	abstract = {One of the most challenging problems in modern neuroimaging is detailed characterization of neurodegeneration. Quantifying spatial and longitudinal atrophy patterns is an important component of this process. These spatiotemporal signals will aid in discriminating between related diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which manifest themselves in the same at-risk population. Here, we develop a novel symmetric image normalization method (SyN) for maximizing the cross-correlation within the space of diffeomorphic maps and provide the Euler-Lagrange equations necessary for this optimization. We then turn to a careful evaluation of our method. Our evaluation uses gold standard, human cortical segmentation to contrast SyN's performance with a related elastic method and with the standard ITK implementation of Thirion's Demons algorithm. The new method compares favorably with both approaches, in particular when the distance between the template brain and the target brain is large. We then report the correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic cortical labelings of FTD and control subjects with those gained by the manual rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods tested, SyN's volume measurements are the most strongly correlated with volume measurements gained by expert labeling. This study indicates that SyN, with cross-correlation, is a reliable method for normalizing and making anatomical measurements in volumetric MRI of patients and at-risk elderly individuals.},

abstract = {Background: Reliable and timely information on the leading causes of death in populations, and how these are changing, is a crucial input into health policy debates. In the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010), we aimed to estimate annual deaths for the world and 21 regions between 1980 and 2010 for 235 causes, with uncertainty intervals (UIs), separately by age and sex. Methods: We attempted to identify all available data on causes of death for 187 countries from 1980 to 2010 from vital registration, verbal autopsy, mortality surveillance, censuses, surveys, hospitals, police records, and mortuaries. We assessed data quality for completeness, diagnostic accuracy, missing data, stochastic variations, and probable causes of death. We applied six different modelling strategies to estimate cause-specific mortality trends depending on the strength of the data. For 133 causes and three special aggregates we used the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) approach, which uses four families of statistical models testing a large set of different models using different permutations of covariates. Model ensembles were developed from these component models. We assessed model performance with rigorous out-of-sample testing of prediction error and the validity of 95{\%} UIs. For 13 causes with low observed numbers of deaths, we developed negative binomial models with plausible covariates. For 27 causes for which death is rare, we modelled the higher level cause in the cause hierarchy of the GBD 2010 and then allocated deaths across component causes proportionately, estimated from all available data in the database. For selected causes (African trypanosomiasis, congenital syphilis, whooping cough, measles, typhoid and parathyroid, leishmaniasis, acute hepatitis E, and HIV/AIDS), we used natural history models based on information on incidence, prevalence, and case-fatality. We separately estimated cause fractions by aetiology for diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and meningitis, as well as disaggregations by subcause for chronic kidney disease, maternal disorders, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. For deaths due to collective violence and natural disasters, we used mortality shock regressions. For every cause, we estimated 95{\%} UIs that captured both parameter estimation uncertainty and uncertainty due to model specification where CODEm was used. We constrained cause-specific fractions within every age-sex group to sum to total mortality based on draws from the uncertainty distributions. Findings: In 2010, there were 52{\textperiodcentered}8 million deaths globally. At the most aggregate level, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes were 24{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} of deaths worldwide in 2010, down from 15{\textperiodcentered}9 million (34{\textperiodcentered}1{\%}) of 46{\textperiodcentered}5 million in 1990. This decrease was largely due to decreases in mortality from diarrhoeal disease (from 2{\textperiodcentered}5 to 1{\textperiodcentered}4 million), lower respiratory infections (from 3{\textperiodcentered}4 to 2{\textperiodcentered}8 million), neonatal disorders (from 3{\textperiodcentered}1 to 2{\textperiodcentered}2 million), measles (from 0{\textperiodcentered}63 to 0{\textperiodcentered}13 million), and tetanus (from 0{\textperiodcentered}27 to 0{\textperiodcentered}06 million). Deaths from HIV/AIDS increased from 0{\textperiodcentered}30 million in 1990 to 1{\textperiodcentered}5 million in 2010, reaching a peak of 1{\textperiodcentered}7 million in 2006. Malaria mortality also rose by an estimated 19{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} since 1990 to 1{\textperiodcentered}17 million deaths in 2010. Tuberculosis killed 1{\textperiodcentered}2 million people in 2010. Deaths from non-communicable diseases rose by just under 8 million between 1990 and 2010, accounting for two of every three deaths (34{\textperiodcentered}5 million) worldwide by 2010. 8 million people died from cancer in 2010, 38{\%} more than two decades ago; of these, 1{\textperiodcentered}5 million (19{\%}) were from trachea, bronchus, and lung cancer. Ischaemic heart disease and stroke collectively killed 12{\textperiodcentered}9 million people in 2010, or one in four deaths worldwide, compared with one in five in 1990; 1{\textperiodcentered}3 million deaths were due to diabetes, twice as many as in 1990. The fraction of global deaths due to injuries (5{\textperiodcentered}1 million deaths) was marginally higher in 2010 (9{\textperiodcentered}6{\%}) compared with two decades earlier (8{\textperiodcentered}8{\%}). This was driven by a 46{\%} rise in deaths worldwide due to road traffic accidents (1{\textperiodcentered}3 million in 2010) and a rise in deaths from falls. Ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lower respiratory infections, lung cancer, and HIV/AIDS were the leading causes of death in 2010. Ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, stroke, diarrhoeal disease, malaria, and HIV/AIDS were the leading causes of years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) in 2010, similar to what was estimated for 1990, except for HIV/AIDS and preterm birth complications. YLLs from lower respiratory infections and diarrhoea decreased by 45-54{\%} since 1990; ischaemic heart disease and stroke YLLs increased by 17-28{\%}. Regional variations in leading causes of death were substantial. Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes still accounted for 76{\%} of premature mortality in sub-Saharan Africa in 2010. Age standardised death rates from some key disorders rose (HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease in particular), but for most diseases, death rates fell in the past two decades; including major vascular diseases, COPD, most forms of cancer, liver cirrhosis, and maternal disorders. For other conditions, notably malaria, prostate cancer, and injuries, little change was noted. Interpretation: Population growth, increased average age of the world's population, and largely decreasing age-specific, sex-specific, and cause-specific death rates combine to drive a broad shift from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes towards non-communicable diseases. Nevertheless, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes remain the dominant causes of YLLs in sub-Saharan Africa. Overlaid on this general pattern of the epidemiological transition, marked regional variation exists in many causes, such as interpersonal violence, suicide, liver cancer, diabetes, cirrhosis, Chagas disease, African trypanosomiasis, melanoma, and others. Regional heterogeneity highlights the importance of sound epidemiological assessments of the causes of death on a regular basis.},

abstract = {Primary liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide and therefore a major public health challenge. We review hypotheses of the cell of origin of liver tumorigenesis and clarify the classes of liver cancer based on molecular features and how they affect patient prognosis. Primary liver cancer comprises hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA), and other rare tumors, notably fibrolamellar carcinoma and hepatoblastoma. The molecular and clinical features of HCC versus iCCA are distinct, but these conditions have overlapping risk factors and pathways of oncogenesis. A better understanding of the cell types originating liver cancer can aid in exploring molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis and therapeutic options. Molecular studies have identified adult hepatocytes as the cell of origin. These cells have been proposed to transform directly into HCC cells (via a sequence of genetic alterations), to dedifferentiate into hepatocyte precursor cells (which then become HCC cells that express progenitor cell markers), or to transdifferentiate into biliary-like cells (which give rise to iCCA). Alternatively, progenitor cells also give rise to HCCs and iCCAs with markers of progenitor cells. Advances in genome profiling and next-generation sequencing have led to the classification of HCCs based on molecular features and assigned them to categories such as proliferation–progenitor, proliferation–transforming growth factor $\beta$, and Wnt–catenin $\beta$1. iCCAs have been assigned to categories of proliferation and inflammation. Overall, proliferation subclasses are associated with a more aggressive phenotype and poor outcome of patients, although more specific signatures have refined our prognostic abilities. Analyses of genetic alterations have identified those that might be targeted therapeutically, such as fusions in the FGFR2 gene and mutations in genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenases (in approximately 60{\%} of iCCAs) or amplifications at 11q13 and 6p21 (in approximately 15{\%} of HCCs). Further studies of these alterations are needed before they can be used as biomarkers in clinical decision making.},

abstract = {Cancer constitutes an enormous burden on society in more and less economically developed countries alike. The occurrence of cancer is increasing because of the growth and aging of the population, as well as an increasing prevalence of established risk factors such as smoking, overweight, physical inactivity, and changing reproductive patterns associated with urbanization and economic development. Based on GLOBOCAN estimates, about 14.1 million new cancer cases and 8.2 million deaths occurred in 2012 worldwide. Over the years, the burden has shifted to less developed countries, which currently account for about 57{\%} of cases and 65{\%} of cancer deaths worldwide. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among males in both more and less developed countries, and has surpassed breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer death among females in more developed countries; breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death among females in less developed countries. Other leading causes of cancer death in more developed countries include colorectal cancer among males and females and prostate cancer among males. In less developed countries, liver and stomach cancer among males and cervical cancer among females are also leading causes of cancer death. Although incidence rates for all cancers combined are nearly twice as high in more developed than in less developed countries in both males and females, mortality rates are only 8{\%} to 15{\%} higher in more developed countries. This disparity reflects regional differences in the mix of cancers, which is affected by risk factors and detection practices, and/or the availability of treatment. Risk factors associated with the leading causes of cancer death include tobacco use (lung, colorectal, stomach, and liver cancer), overweight/obesity and physical inactivity (breast and colorectal cancer), and infection (liver, stomach, and cervical cancer). A substantial portion of cancer cases and deaths could be prevented by broadly applying effective prevention measures, such as tobacco control, vaccination, and the use of early detection tests.},

abstract = {The burden of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of liver cancer, is steadily growing because obesity, type 2 diabetes, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are replacing viral- and alcohol-related liver disease as major pathogenic promoters. The most worrisome aspects of these new risk factors are their large spread in the general population and their link with HCC arising in noncirrhotic livers. HCC may be the presenting feature of an asymptomatic nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the progressive form of NAFLD. The HCC risk connected to metabolic factors has been underestimated so far, and a poorer surveillance has prevented an adequate treatment. Systemic and hepatic molecular mechanisms involved in obesity- and NAFLD-induced hepatocarcinogenesis as well as potential early markers of HCC are being extensively investigated. This review summarizes current evidence linking obesity, NAFLD and liver cancer, discusses its clinical impact and describes the main mechanisms underlying this complex relationship.},

abstract = {The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the United States is increasing, but the clinical characteristics of American patients with HCC have not been well described. The aims of this study were to determine the etiology of liver disease and short-term outcome among HCC patients presenting to a single center in the United States. One hundred five consecutive patients with HCC were studied; mean age was 59 years, 67{\%} were men, and 76{\%} were non-Hispanic white. The most common etiology of liver disease was hepatitis C (51{\%}) and cryptogenic cirrhosis (29{\%}). Half of the patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis had histologic or clinical features associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Fifty-three (50{\%}) patients had HCC detected during surveillance (group I), whereas the remaining patients had symptomatic tumors (group II). Group I patients had smaller tumors (P = .01), were more likely to be eligible for surgical treatment (P = .005), and had a better median survival compared with patients in group II (P = .001). Patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis were less likely to have undergone HCC surveillance and had larger tumors at diagnosis. In conclusion, hepatitis C and cryptogenic liver disease are the most common etiologies of diseases in our patients with HCC. NAFLD accounted for at least 13{\%} of the cases. Patients who underwent surveillance had smaller tumors and were more likely to be candidates for surgical or local ablative therapies. Because of the increasing incidence of NAFLD, further studies are needed to determine the risk of HCC in patients with NAFLD.},

abstract = {Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a newly identified risk factor in chronic liver disease (CLD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to analyze the pathological characteristics of HCC and nontumoral liver in patients with MS as the only risk factor for liver disease in comparison with those that developed in the course of other CLDs in order to provide further insight into the physiopathology of HCC associated with MS. HCC patients with features of MS as the only risk factor for liver diseases (MS group, n=31) were compared to HCC patients with overt causes of CLD (CLD group, n=81) or without causes of CLD (cryptogenic group, n = 16) who underwent surgical resection during the same period of time. Among the patients of the MS group, there were 30 males and 1 female. In comparison with the patients with HCC of the CLD group, the patients with MS were older (mean age: 67±7 versus 59 ± 14 years, P {\textless} 0.01), and the background liver was significantly more often free of significant fibrosis (F0-F2: 65{\%} in the MS group versus 26{\%} in the CLD group, P {\textless} 0.001). In addition, HCCs associated with MS were more often well differentiated (65{\%} versus 28{\%}, P {\textless} 0.001). Five HCCs, all from the MS group, developed on a preexisting liver cell adenoma, with three of them showing typical histological features of telangiectatic adenoma. Conclusion: This study shows that HCCs in patients with features of MS as the only risk factor for liver disease have distinct morphological characteristics and mainly occur in the absence of significant fibrosis in the background liver. In addition, some of them arise through malignant transformation of a preexisting liver cell adenoma. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2008 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.},

@article{Dyson2014,
abstract = {Background {\&} Aims Hepatocellular cancer (HCC) commonly complicates chronic liver disease and increases in incidence have been reported despite falling prevalences of viral hepatitis. Methods Following the introduction of centralised specialist teams to manage patients with cancer in England, we characterised the demographics of patients with HCC referred to the Newcastle-upon-Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust between 2000 and 2010. Regional HCC mortality data was from Public Health England. Results HCC related mortality in the region rose 1.8 fold in 10 years, from 2.0 to 3.7 per 100,000. 632 cases were reviewed centrally, with 2-3 fold increases in referrals of patients with associated hepatitis C, alcoholic liver disease or no chronic liver disease and a {\textgreater}10 fold increase in HCC associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). By 2010 NAFLD accounted for 41/118 (34.8{\%}) cases. Irrespective of associated etiologies, metabolic risk factors were present in 78/118 (66.1{\%}) cases in 2010, associated with regional increases in obesity and diabetes. Median overall survival was just 10.7 months. Although patients with NAFLD associated HCC were older (71.3 yr vs. 67.1 yr; p {\textless}0.001) and their cancers less often detected by surveillance, their survival was similar to other etiologies. This was attributed to significantly higher incidental presentation (38.2{\%}) and lower prevalence of cirrhosis (77.2{\%}). Conclusions HCC related mortality is increasing, with typical patients being elderly with metabolic risk factors. The prognosis for most of the cases is poor, but older patients with co-morbidities can do well, managed, within a specialist multidisciplinary team if their cancer is detected pre-symptomatically. {\textcopyright} 2013 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

The trends in NASH-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among LT recipients in the U.S. remain undefined. We performed a retrospective cohort study to evaluate trends in the etiology of HCC among adult LT recipients in the U.S. from 2002 to 2012, using national data from the United Network for Organ Sharing registry. From 2002-2012, there were 61,868 adults who underwent LT in the U.S., including 10,061 patients with HCC. The total number and proportion of HCC LT recipients demonstrated a significant increase following the implementation of the Model for Endstage Liver Disease (MELD) scoring system in 2002 (3.3{\%}, n=143 in 2000 versus 12.2{\%}, n=714 in 2005 versus 23.3{\%}, n=1336 in 2012). The proportion of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related HCC increased steadily from 2002 to 2012, and HCV remained the leading etiology of HCC throughout the MELD era (43.4{\%} in 2002 versus 46.3{\%} in 2007 versus 49.9{\%} in 2012). NASH-related HCC also increased significantly, and NASH is the second leading etiology of HCC-related LT (8.3{\%} in 2002 versus 10.3{\%} in 2007 versus 13.5{\%} in 2012). From 2002 to 2012, the number of patients undergoing LT for HCC secondary to NASH increased by nearly 4-fold, and the number of LT patients with HCC secondary to HCV increased by 2-fold.

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, no systemic studies from the United States have examined temporal trends, HCC surveillance practices, and outcomes of NAFLD-related HCC. Methods: We identified a national cohort of 1500 patients who developed HCC from 2005 through 2010 from Veterans Administration (VA) hospitals. We reviewed patients' full VA medical records; NAFLD was diagnosed based on histologic evidence for, or the presence of, the metabolic syndrome in the absence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, hepatitis B, or alcoholic liver disease. We compared annual prevalence values for the main risk factors (NAFLD, alcohol abuse, and HCV), as well a HCC surveillance and outcomes, among HCC patients. Results: NAFLD was the underlying risk factor for HCC in 120 patients (8.0{\%}); the annual proportion of NAFLD-related HCC remained relatively stable (7.5{\%}-12.0{\%}). In contrast, the proportion of HCC cases associated with HCV increased from 61.0{\%} in 2005 (95{\%} confidence interval, 53.1{\%}-68.9{\%}) to 74.9{\%} in 2010 (95{\%} confidence interval, 69.0{\%}-80.7{\%}). The proportion of HCC cases associated with only alcohol abuse decreased from 21.9{\%} in 2005 to 15.7{\%} in 2010, and the annual proportion of HCC cases associated with hepatitis B remained relatively stable (1.4{\%}-3.5{\%}). A significantly lower proportion of patients with NAFLD-related HCC had cirrhosis (58.3{\%}) compared with patients with alcohol- or HCV-related HCC (72.4{\%} and 85.6{\%}, respectively; P {\textless} .05). A significantly higher percentage of patients with NAFLD-related HCC did not receive HCC surveillance in the 3 years before their HCC diagnosis, compared with patients with alcohol- or HCV-associated HCC. A lower proportion of patients with NAFLD-related HCC received HCC-specific treatment (61.5{\%}) than patients with HCV-related HCC (77.5{\%}; P {\textless} .01). However, the 1-year survival rate did not differ among patients with HCC related to different risk factors. Conclusions: NAFLD is the third most common risk factor for HCC in the VA population. The proportion of NAFLD-related HCC was relatively stable from 2005 through 2010. Although patients with NAFLD-related HCC received less HCC surveillance and treatment, a similar proportion survive for 1 year, compared with patients with alcohol-related or HCV-related HCC.},

abstract = {Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a well-recognized cause of cirrhosis and has been increasingly associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aims of this study were to (1) estimate the incidence of HCC in patients with NASHrelated cirrhosis, (2) compare incidence in NASH-related cirrhosis with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related cirrhosis, and (3) identify risk factors of HCC in patients with NASHrelated cirrhosis compared with HCV-related cirrhosis. Adult patients with cirrhosis secondary to chronic HCV (n = 315) or NASH (n = 195) were evaluated at our hepatobiliary clinic between 2003 and 2007. To assess for HCC development, all patients were monitored using serial abdominal computed tomography and serum alpha-fetoprotein every 6 months. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to estimate the cumulative incidence of HCC. Descriptive statistics were computed for all factors. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to assess associations between HCC and factors of interest. The median follow-up was 3.2 years (25th percentile [P25], 75th percentile [P75]: 1.7, 5.7) during which 25/195 (12.8{\%}) of NASH-cirrhotic and 64/315 (20.3 {\%}) of HCV-cirrhotic patients developed HCC (P = 0.03). Yearly cumulative incidence of HCC was found to be 2.6{\%} in patients with NASH-cirrhosis, compared with 4.0{\%} in patients with HCV cirrhosis (P = 0.09). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that older age (P = 0.006) and alcohol consumption (P = 0.002) were independent variables associated with development of HCC in patients with NASH-cirrhosis. Compared with nondrinkers, patients who reported any regular alcohol consumption were at greater risk for HCC development (hazard ratio: 3.6; P25, P75: 1.5, 8.3). Conclusion: Patients with NASH cirrhosis have a greatly increased risk of liver cancer. Alcohol consumption, a modifiable risk factor, appears to be the most significant factor associated with risk of HCC development in our study population.

However, the optimal timing of such intervention remains uncertain. METHODS We randomly assigned 3031 patients with acute coronary syndromes to undergo either routine early intervention (coronary angiography {\textless} or = 24 hours after randomization) or delayed intervention (coronary angiography {\textgreater} or = 36 hours after randomization). The primary outcome was a composite of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke at 6 months. A prespecified secondary outcome was death, myocardial infarction, or refractory ischemia at 6 months. RESULTS Coronary angiography was performed in 97.6{\%} of patients in the early-intervention group (median time, 14 hours) and in 95.7{\%} of patients in the delayed-intervention group (median time, 50 hours). At 6 months, the primary outcome occurred in 9.6{\%} of patients in the early-intervention group, as compared with 11.3{\%} in the delayed-intervention group (hazard ratio in the early-intervention group, 0.85; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.68 to 1.06; P=0.15). There was a relative reduction of 28{\%} in the secondary outcome of death, myocardial infarction, or refractory ischemia in the early-intervention group (9.5{\%}), as compared with the delayed-intervention group (12.9{\%}) (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95{\%} CI, 0.58 to 0.89; P=0.003). Prespecified analyses showed that early intervention improved the primary outcome in the third of patients who were at highest risk (hazard ratio, 0.65; 95{\%} CI, 0.48 to 0.89) but not in the two thirds at low-to-intermediate risk (hazard ratio, 1.12; 95{\%} CI, 0.81 to 1.56; P=0.01 for heterogeneity). CONCLUSIONS Early intervention did not differ greatly from delayed intervention in preventing the primary outcome, but it did reduce the rate of the composite secondary outcome of death, myocardial infarction, or refractory ischemia and was superior to delayed intervention in high-risk patients.

METHODS: In the Whitehall prospective cohort study of London-based government employees, 18 403 middle-age men participated in a medical examination between 1967 and 1970. Subjects were followed up for cause-specific mortality for up to 35y (median: interquartile range (25th-75th centile); 28.1y: 18.6-33.8). RESULTS: There were over 3000 cancer deaths in this cohort. There was a raised risk of mortality from carcinoma of the rectum, bladder, colon, and liver, and for lymphoma in obese or overweight men following adjustment for range of covariates, which included socioeconomic position and physical activity. These relationships held after exclusion of deaths occurring in the first 20y of follow-up. CONCLUSION: Avoidance of obesity and overweight in adult life may reduce the risk of developing some cancers. {\textcopyright} 2005 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Purpose: The effects of excess weight on the development of cancers are controversial, and little is known for populations outside the United States and Europe. We conducted this study to assess the effects of excess weight with a large cohort of Koreans. Methods: We assessed the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and various cancers in a 10-year follow-up cohort of 781,283 Korean men who were free of prior cancer at baseline. Weight and height were measured, and questionnaires related to health behaviors and medical history were completed. Data on newly developed cancers were obtained from two organizations in Korea. A proportional hazards model was used to examine the relationship between BMI and cancer. Results: Adenocarcinoma in the colon and rectosigmoid, hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, adenocarcinoma in the prostate, renal cell carcinoma, papillary carcinoma in the thyroid, small-cell carcinoma in the lung, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and melanoma had positive dose-dependent relationships with BMI (all P {\textless} .05). Although no linear trend was found (P = .267), obese men who never smoked with a BMI of ≥ 30 kg/m2 had an increased risk of developing gastric adenocarcinoma (relative risk = 1.73). Other cancers, such as leukemia, multiple myeloma, and gallbladder and pancreatic cancer, did not show significant associations. Conclusion: These findings show that, even in Koreans, obesity clearly increases the risk of many types of cancers and the strength of the associations varies with the organ and histologic type. Because these obesity-related cancers are reported to be rapidly increasing in Korea and many other Asian countries, controlling obesity epidemics could be an effective tool for preventing these cancers in these areas. {\textcopyright} 2005 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.},

abstract = {Background: Obesity has been linked with increased risk for cancers of the colon, kidney, breast, endometrium and gallbladder. For other cancer sites, the relationship with obesity is less well quantified, and the effect of weight change on cancer risk is unclear. Methods: We examined the health records of 362,552 Swedish men who underwent at least one physical examination from 1971 to 1992, and were followed until death or the end of 1999. Incident cancer cases were identified by linkage to the Swedish cancer registry. Poisson regression models were used to estimate relative risks of cancer for both body-mass index (BMI) at baseline exam and, in a subgroup of 107,815 men, change in BMI after six years of follow-up, adjusting for age and smoking status. Results: Compared to men of normal weight, obese men had a significantly increased risk of all cancers combined (RR = 1.1; 95{\%} CI = 1.0-1.2). The risks were most pronounced for esophageal adenocarcinoma (RR = 2.7; 95{\%} CI = 1.3-5.6), renal cell carcinoma (RR = 1.8; 95{\%} CI = 1.4-2.4), malignant melanoma (RR = 1.4; 95{\%} CI = 1.1-1.7), and cancers of the colon (RR = 1.7; 95{\%} CI = 1.5-2.0), rectum (RR = 1.4; 95{\%} CI = 1.1-1.7), and liver (RR = 3.6; 95{\%} CI = 2.6-5.0). Risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma was elevated for underweight men whose BMI was less than 18.5 (RR = 3.1; 95{\%} CI = 1.1-8.3). An excess risk for cancers of the pancreas and connective tissue was observed only among nonsmokers. Compared to men whose weight remained stable, men with more than a 15{\%} increase in BMI after six years of follow-up had an elevated risk of pancreas and renal cell cancers. Conclusions: Obesity and weight gain increase the risk for several forms of cancer in men, and underscore the need for further study into carcinogenic mechanisms and preventive interventions. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: This study investigated whether obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic factors are independently associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), stratified by hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) serostatus, and explored the possible joint influence of obesity/diabetes and HBV/HCV infections on the risk of HCC. Methods: A total of 23,820 residents in Taiwan were recruited and followed up for 14 years. All analyses were stratified by hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) at enrollment, and 218 subjects positive for both seromarkers were excluded. Incident HCC cases were identified via linkage to the national cancer registry. Multivariate-adjusted relative risk (RRa) and 95{\%} confidence interval (95{\%} CI) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Extreme obesity (body mass index ≥30 kg/m2) was independently associated with a 4-fold risk of HCC (RRa, 4.13; 95{\%} CI, 1.38-12.4) among anti-HCV-seropositive subjects and a 2-fold risk (RRa, 2.36; 95{\%} CI, 0.91-6.17) in persons without HBV and HCV infections, after controlling for other metabolic components, but not in HBsAg-seropositive subjects (RRa, 1.36; 95{\%} CI, 0.64-2.89). Diabetes was associated with HCC in all 3 groups, with the highest risk in those with HCV infection (RRa, 3.52; 95{\%} CI, 1.29-9.24) and lowest in HBV carriers (RRa, 2.27; 95{\%} CI, 1.10-4.66). We found more than 100-fold increased risk in HBV or HCV carriers with both obesity and diabetes, indicating synergistic effects of metabolic factors and hepatitis. Conclusions: The finding that both obesity and diabetes are predictors of HCC risk, possibly differently depending on HBV and HCV infection status, may shed some light in preventing HCC. {\textcopyright} 2008 AGA Institute.},

abstract = {Aims: Several meta-analyses have shown that diabetes mellitus affects the risk of certain site-specific cancers. However, a meta-analysis on the overall risk of cancer has not yet been performed. Methods: We performed a search of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library for pertinent articles (including their references) that had been published as of June 10, 2010. English-language, original observational cohort studies and case-control studies conducted in Japan were included for a qualitative review and a meta-analysis. Results: A total of 22,485 cancer cases were reported in four cohort studies and one case-control study (with a total of 250,479 subjects). With these five reports, a meta-analysis of the all-cancer risk in both men and women showed an increased risk in subjects with diabetes, compared with nondiabetic subjects (OR 1.70, 95{\%} CI 1.38-2.10). The increase in the risk ratio adjusted for possible confounders was significant in men and borderline in women (adjusted RR 1.25, 95{\%} CI 1.06-1.46 in men; adjusted RR 1.23, 95{\%} CI 0.97-1.56 in women). An analysis of site-specific cancers revealed increased risks for incident hepatocellular cancer (OR 3.64, 95{\%} CI 2.61-5.07) and endometrial cancer (OR 3.43, 95{\%} CI 1.53-7.72). Conclusions: As is the case in Western countries, Asian people with diabetes have a higher risk of incident cancer than those without diabetes. Cancer prevention and early detection should be important components of diabetes management in light of the exponentially increasing prevalence of diabetes, which has substantial implications in public health and clinical practices. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Wideroff1997,
abstract = {Background: Diabetes has been associated with an increased risk of several cancers, notably cancers of the pancreas, liver, endometrium, and kidney. Since most previous studies have involved a limited sample size or focused on specific cancer sites, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of the risk of cancer in a nationwide cohort of diabetics in Denmark. Methods: Discharge records of 109 581 individuals hospitalized with a diagnosis of diabetes from 1977 through 1989 were linked with national cancer registry records through 1993. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for specific cancer sites. Results: The SIRs for primary liver cancer were 4.0 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 3.5-4.6) in males and 2.1 (95{\%} CI = 1.6- 2.7) in females. These SIRs remained elevated with increasing years of follow-up and after exclusion of patients with re-ported risk factors (e.g., cirrhosis and hepatitis) or patients whose cancers were diagnosed at autopsy. Kidney cancer risk was also elevated, with SIRs of 1.4 (95{\%} CI = 1.2-1.6) in males and 1.7 (95{\%} CI = 1.4-1.9) in females. For both sexes combined, the SIR for pancreatic cancer was 2.1 (95{\%} CI = 1.9-2.4), with a follow-up time of 1- 4 years; this SIR declined to 1.3 (95{\%} CI = 1.1-1.6) after 5-9 years of follow-up. Excess risks were also observed for biliary tract and endometrial cancers. The SIRs for kidney and endometrial cancers declined somewhat after exclusion of diabetics with reported obesity. Conclusions: Patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of diabetes appear to be at higher risk of developing cancers of the liver, biliary tract, pancreas, endometrium, and kidney. The elevated risks of endometrial and kidney cancers, however, may be confounded by obesity.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: An association between diabetes and chronic liver disease has been reported. However, the temporal relationship between these conditions remalns unknown. Methods: We identified all patients with a hospital discharge diagnosis of diabetes between 1985 and 1990 using the computerized records of the Department of Veterans Affairs. We randomly assigned 3 patients without diabetes for every patient with diabetes. We excluded patients with concomitant liver disease. The remaining cohort was followed through 2000 for the occurrence of chronic nonalcoholic liver disease (CNLD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hazard rate ratios (HRR) were determined in Cox proportional hazard survival analysis. Results: The study cohort comprised 173,643 patients with diabetes and 650,620 patients without diabetes. Most were men (98{\%}). Patients with diabetes were older (62 vs. 54 years) than patients without diabetes. The incidence of chronic nonalcoholic liver disease was significantly higher among patients with diabetes (incidence rate: 18.13 vs. 9.55 per 10,000 person-years, respectively, P {\textless} 0.0001). Similar results were obtained for HCC (incidence rate: 2.39 vs. 0.87 per 10,000 person-years, respectively, P {\textless} 0.0001). Diabetes was associated with an HRR of 1.98 (95{\%} CI: 1.88 to 2.09, P {\textless} 0.0001) of CNLD and an HRR of 2.16 (1.86 to 2.52, P {\textless} 0.0001) of hepatocellular carcinoma. Diabetes carried the highest risk among patients with longer than 10 years of follow-up. Conclusions: Among men with diabetes, the risk of CNLD and HCC is doubled. This increase in risk is independent of alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis, or demographic features.},

abstract = {Background: Diabetes has been associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in studies of referred patients. This is the first population based case control study in the USA to examine this association while adjusting for other major risk factors related to HCC. Methods: We used the Surveillance Epidemiology and End-Results Program (SEER)-Medicare linked database to identify patients aged 65 years and older diagnosed with HCC and randomly selected non-cancer controls between 1994 and 1999. Only cases and controls with continuous Medicare enrolment for three years prior to the index date were examined. Inpatient and outpatient claims files were searched for diagnostic codes indicative of diabetes, hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), alcoholic liver disease, and haemochromatosis. HCC patients without these conditions were categorised as idiopathic. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios were calculated in logistic regression analyses. Results: We identified 2061 HCC patients and 6183 non-cancer controls. Compared with non-cancer controls, patients with HCC were male (66{\%} v 36{\%}) and non-White (34{\%} v 18{\%}). The proportion of HCC patients with diabetes (43{\%}) was significantly greater than non-cancer controls (19{\%}). In multiple logistic regression analyses that adjusted for demographics features and other HCC risk factors (HCV, HBV, alcoholic liver disease, and haemochromatosis), diabetes was associated with a threefold increase in the risk of HCC. In a subset of patients without these major risk factors, the adjusted odds ratio for diabetes declined but remained significant (adjusted odds ratio 2.87 (95{\%} confidence interval 2.49-3.30)). A significant positive interaction between HCV and diabetes was detected (p{\textless}0.0001). Similar findings persisted in analyses restricted to diabetes recorded between two and three years prior to HCC diagnosis. Conclusions: Diabetes is associated with a 2-3-fold increase in the risk of HCC, regardless of the presence of other major HCC risk factors. Findings from this population based study suggest that diabetes is an independent risk factor for HCC.},

abstract = {Although diabetes has been known to increase the risk of cancer for over a century, it was not until recently when this area gained momentum and generated a lot of interest. That is in- part because of the rising global diabetes epidemic and the wide spread use of insulin analogues, metformin and other anti-diabetic agents, providing hypothesis generating data on the cancer risk in the diabetic population. Type 2 diabetes is associated with increased risk of breast, colon, pancreatic and other types of cancer, while type 1 diabetes is associated with increase in stomach, pancreatic, endometrial and cervical cancer. Mechanisms postulated for increased cancer risk in diabetes include hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia with stimulation of IGF-1 axis, obesity that serves as a common soil hypothesis for both cancer and diabetes as well as other factors such as increased cytokine production. More recently some antidiabetic agents have been thought to increase cancer risk such as insulin glargine, while metformin appears to lower cancer risk. In this review, we present the evidence for the link between diabetes and cancer highlighting the general mechanisms proposed for such a link as well as specific hypotheses for individual cancer. We will also discuss the role of insulin, metformin and other antidiabetic agents in cancer risk.},

We evaluated prognostic values of Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage compared with other staging systems, and identified discrepancies between treatment options chosen in Korean clinical practice and BCLC guidelines. Methods: Between 2003 and 2008, 1717 prospectively enrolled patients with treatment-na{\"{i}}ve HCC were analysed. Prognostic ability of each staging system was assessed using time-dependent receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: The most common aetiology was hepatitis B virus (1238, 72.1{\%}); 167 (9.8{\%}) patients were classified as BCLC stage 0, 526 (30.6{\%}) as A, 333 (19.4{\%}) as B, 608 (35.4{\%}) as C and 83 (4.8{\%}) as D. Median overall survival was 22.5 months, and 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year survival rates were 62.6, 48.3, 39.9, 34.7, and 29.3{\%} respectively. Of six staging systems, BCLC had the highest area under ROC (AUROC; 0.821) for overall survival, followed by JIS (0.809), Tokyo score (0.771), CLIP (0.746), CUPI (0.701) and GRETCH (0.685) system. In both subgroups stratified according to treatment strategy (curative vs. palliative), BCLC also showed the best AUROCs (curative, 0.708/palliative, 0.807) for overall survival. Regarding discrepancies between treatment options chosen in our cohort and BCLC guidelines, more than half with very early/early-stage HCC underwent transarterial chemoembolization, rather than resection or local ablative therapy; most of those with advanced-stage HCC received intra-arterial chemotherapy-based treatments rather than sorafenib. Conclusion: BCLC was the best long-term prognostic model for treatment-na{\"{i}}ve HCC in a large-scale Korean cohort.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to compare the diagnostic performance of gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI with that of 16-MDCT for the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Thirty-one patients with 53 hepatocellular carcinomas underwent gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced dynamic MRI and multiphasic CT using 16-MDCT within a mean interval of 5 days (range, 3-9 days). The dynamic MRI examination was performed using 3D fat-saturated volumetric interpolated imaging and sensitivity encoding on a 1.5-T unit. Both dynamic MRI and multiphasic MDCT included dual arterial phase images. Three observers independently interpreted the CT and MR images in random order, separately, and without patient identifiers. The diagnostic accuracy of each technique was evaluated using the alternative-free response ROC method. The sensitivity and positive predictive values were also calculated. RESULTS. The sensitivities of gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI for all observers were significantly higher than those of MDCT for all the lesions and for lesions 1.0 cm or smaller (p {\textless} 0.05); however, for lesions larger than 1.0 cm, the sensitivities of the two imaging techniques were similar. The mean area under the ROC curve (Az) of gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI (0.87 ± 0.03 [SD]) was higher than that of MDCT (0.83 ± 0.04), but no significant difference was found between them (p = 0.31). The number of false-positive findings on dynamic MRI was slightly higher than on MDCT, but no significant difference in the positive predictive value between the two imaging techniques was detected (observer 1, p = 0.06; observer 2, p = 0.13; observer 3, p = 1.00). CONCLUSION. Gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI has a higher sensitivity for small hepatocellular carcinomas (≤ 1 cm) but a higher false-positive rate due to nonspecific enhancement of benign lesions, such as arterioportal shunt, leading to no significant difference of overall accuracy when compared with MDCT. {\textcopyright} American Roentgen Ray Society.},

@article{Llovet2005,
abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide, and its incidence will further increase, to reach a plateau in 2015-2020. The natural history of the disease is quite well known, except for its early stages, because the majority of patients at this stage are treated with radical approaches. Staging systems are key to predict the prognostics of patients with cancer, to stratify the patients according to prognostic variables in the setting of clinical trials, and to guide the therapeutic approach. The current knowledge of the disease, however, is not sufficient for recommending a staging system to be used worldwide. The conventional staging systems - Okuda stage, and TNM stage - have shown important limitations for classifying patients. Several new systems have been recently proposed, but only three of them have been validated. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging classification links the stage of the disease to a specific treatment strategy. The Japan Integrated Staging (JIS) score has been proposed and used in Japan, although it needs Western validation. The Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score is mainly proposed for patients with advanced tumors. Early detection of HCC through surveillance programs allows the application of potentially curative therapies, such as resection, liver transplantation, and percutaneous ablation in patients with early tumors. The applicability of these treatments varies according to geographical distribution: from 50{\%} to 70{\%} of cases in Japan; 25{\%} to 40{\%} of cases in Europe and the United States; and fewer than 10{\%} in Africa. There are no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any of the three major therapies. These studies are not feasible in the West. Therefore, there is no firm evidence to establish the optimal first-line treatment for small single HCC in patients with well-preserved liver function. Resection and transplantation achieve the best outcomes in well-selected candidates (5-year survival of 60{\%}-70{\%}), and compete as the first option from an intention-to-treat perspective. If surgery is precluded, local, nonsurgical therapies are applied. Percutaneous treatments provide good results (5-year survival of 40{\%}-50{\%}), but are unable to achieve response rates and outcomes comparable to those for surgical treatments, even when applied as the first option. Radiofrequency thermal ablation provides slightly better objective response rates than ethanol injection, but no survival advantages have been fully demonstrated. The remaining treatments have been assessed in the setting of around 70 RCTs conducted during the past 25 years. Chemoembolization has been shown to provide modest survival advantages in two RCTs and a metaanalysis, and is currently the mainstay of treatment in 10{\%} of the whole HCC population. The ideal candidates for this option are patients with well-preserved liver function (Child-Pugh class A) and multinodular asymptomatic tumors without vascular invasion. Further RCTs are needed to assess the best chemotherapeutic agent and the ideal re-treatment schedule. There is no firstline option for patients with advanced HCC (vascular invasion, extrahepatic spread, or cancer-related symptoms). Systemic doxorubicin provides partial responses in 10{\%} of cases, without proven survival advantages, and well-known treatment-related complications. Several other treatments, such as immunotherapy, internal radiation, tamoxifen, or anti-androgen agents, have not shown any relevant anti-tumoral effect or survival benefit. New drugs, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors and anti-angiogenic agents, are currently being tested in the setting of clinical trials. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Tokyo 2005.},

abstract = {Hepatocarcinogenesis is a slow process during which genomic changes progressively alter the hepatocellular phenotype to produce cellular intermediates that evolve into hepatocellular carcinoma. During the long preneoplastic stage, in which the liver is often the site of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or both, hepatocyte cycling is accelerated by upregulation of mitogenic pathways, in part through epigenetic mechanisms. This leads to the production of monoclonal populations of aberrant and dysplastic hepatocytes that have telomere erosion and telomerase re-expression, sometimes microsatellite instability, and occasionally structural aberrations in genes and chromosomes. Development of dysplastic hepatocytes in foci and nodules and emergence of hepatocellular carcinoma are associated with the accumulation of irreversible structural alterations in genes and chromosomes, but the genomic basis of the malignant phenotype is heterogeneous. The malignant hepatocyte phenotype may be produced by the disruption of a number of genes that function in different regulatory pathways, producing several molecular variants of hepatocellular carcinoma. New strategies should enable these variants to be characterized. {\textcopyright} 2002 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are generally dormant or slowly cycling tumor cells that have the ability to reconstitute tumors. They are thought to be involved in tumor resistance to chemo/radiation therapy and tumor relapse and progression. However, neither their existence nor their identity within many cancers has been well defined. Here, we have demonstrated that CD13 is a marker for semiquiescent CSCs in human liver cancer cell lines and clinical samples and that targeting these cells might provide a way to treat this disease. CD13+ cells predominated in the G0 phase of the cell cycle and typically formed cellular clusters in cancer foci. Following treatment, these cells survived and were enriched along the fibrous capsule where liver cancers usually relapse. Mechanistically, CD13 reduced ROS-induced DNA damage after genotoxic chemo/radiation stress and protected cells from apoptosis. In mouse xenograft models, combination of a CD13 inhibitor and the genotoxic chemotherapeutic fluorouracil (5-FU) drastically reduced tumor volume compared with either agent alone. 5-FU inhibited CD90+ proliferating CSCs, some of which produce CD13+ semiquiescent CSCs, while CD13 inhibition suppressed the self-renewing and tumor-initiating ability of dormant CSCs. Therefore, combining a CD13 inhibitor with a ROS-inducing chemo/radiation therapy may improve the treatment of liver cancer.},

Some of the biological steps involved in cell transformation and different carcinogenic pathways have been identified, disclosing potential novel markers for HCC. Following the progress in surveillance and early diagnosis, much more is now known about precancerous lesions and the process leading to overt HCC, including growth patterns, dedifferentiation and neoangiogenenesis. In particular, research has focused on clinical and biological factors predicting tumor aggressiveness and patients' prognosis. Lastly, clinical studies have described tumor presentation, evolution and causes of patients' death and how the new knowledge has influenced clinical management and patients' survival in recent years.

@article{Park2011,
abstract = {Context.-There is increasing evidence to support a multistep model of the process of human hepatocarcinogenesis. Precursor lesions are characterized by the appearance of dysplastic lesions in the form of microscopic dysplastic foci and macroscopic dysplastic nodules. There are 2 types of small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ({\textless}2 cm in diameter): (1) early HCC with an indistinct margin and (2) progressed HCC with a distinct margin. Pathologic diagnostic criteria for early HCC have recently been set up based on a consensus between Eastern and Western pathologists. Objective.-To review the nomenclature, pathology, and biomarkers of precursor and early lesions of HCC. Data Sources.-Literature review and illustrations from case materials were used. Conclusions.-Dysplastic foci are composed of large and small cell changes. Small cell change is considered to be a more advanced precursor lesion than large cell change, and large cell change is a rather heterogeneous lesion that may represent both reactive change and true dysplasia. Dysplastic nodules can be categorized as low or high grade according to the degree of atypia. High-grade dysplastic nodules have been reported to show molecular changes similar to HCC and have a high risk of malignant transformation. Early HCC, which may correspond to microinvasive carcinomas of other organs, is a welldifferentiated HCC, and differential diagnosis between early HCC and high-grade dysplastic nodule is difficult. Identification of stromal invasion and application of a panel of markers (glypican-3, heat shock protein 70, and glutamine synthetase) is helpful for diagnosis of early HCC. Detection of precursor lesions of HCC is important in recognizing patients with higher risk of developing HCC, and diagnosis of early HCC can improve patient survival by allowing for early and adequate treatment.},

We encountered 77 cases of type A (68.8%) and 35 of type B (31.2%). The frequency of type A in cirrhotic group (74.7%) is statistically higher than that of non-cirrhotic group (54.5%) (p=0.0453). Using multivariate analysis, the occurrence of type A was related with higher age, the presence of cirrhosis and hepatitis B surface antigen positive. The tumor size and the presence of fatty change in the tumor tended to relate with type A.

@article{Khalili2011,
abstract = {In the latest hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) management guidelines by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, biopsy is advocated for all nodules deemed indeterminate after imaging work-up by contrast-enhanced scans. However, the latest guidelines' imaging work-up algorithm has been shown to improve sensitivity of characterization of HCC for 1-2-cm nodules, decreasing the proportion of HCCs that remain indeterminate after imaging work-up. We undertook a study of 1-2-cm indeterminate nodules to determine what proportions are malignant and which variables can be used to limit biopsy to a subset of nodules at higher risk of malignancy. Eighty consecutive patients with 93 indeterminate nodules were included. Final diagnosis was established in 85 nodules, with 13 malignant (9 by biopsy, 4 by growth) and 72 benign (stability of ≥18 months). Cause of liver disease, ethnicity, size, arterial hypervascularity, venous hypoenhancement, and presence of synchronous typical HCC were analyzed by univariate logistic analysis to determine significant predictors of malignancy. Rate of malignancy among indeterminate 1-2-cm nodules was found to be 14{\%}-23{\%}. Only arterial hypervascularity [odds ratio (OR), 3.7) and presence of synchronous HCC (OR, 7.1) were significant predictors of malignancy. A strategy of limiting biopsy to nodules that had either feature would result in 23 biopsies and potentially detect 8 of 13 malignant nodules, yielding a sensitivity of 62{\%} and specificity of 79{\%}. Conclusion: The prevalence of malignancy among 1-2-cm indeterminate nodules is low (14{\%}-23{\%}), and biopsy of all such nodules results in many negative results. Limiting biopsy to nodules with arterial hypervascularity or in the presence of a synchronous typical HCC would detect the majority of HCCs while substantially reducing the number of biopsies.

Concluded important consensuses, which were well accepted by Japanese HCC specialists, are as follows. (1) Patients with type B or type C liver cirrhosis, who are an ultrahigh-risk group of liver cancer, should be screened every 3-4 months by ultrasonography and measurement of AFP and PIVKA-II. (2) Gd-EOB-MRI is useful for the diagnosis of early HCC. (3) The JIS score is more useful for the staging of liver cancer than the BCLC staging system, which is a global standard. (4) The TNM staging system by the Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan is superior to the TNM stage by the AJCC/UICC. (5) The therapeutic algorithm in the Japanese guidelines for the management of liver cancer is superior to the BCLC treatment algorithm. (6) Early stage. Liver cancers should be treated by radiofrequency ablation if they are ≤2 cm, and by surgical resection if they are Child-Pugh A solitary lesions. (7) Liver transplantation is only indicated for Child-Pugh C patients within Milan Criteria. In conclusion, these consensuses seem to well reflect the real practice pattern of the management of HCC in Japan and provide valuable information for other countries as well.

abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an important health issue worldwide. It is a liver malignancy with heterogeneous etiologies. Among them, chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is one major cause. In chronically infected hepatocytes, HCV directly induces oxidative stress, impairs DNA damage response, manipulates cell cycle control and generates insulin resistance, possibly promoting DNA mutations accumulated in host genome from hepatitis stages in a long time. The predisposing polymorphisms or genetic mutations in critical proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, in synergy with epigenetic alterations after HCV invasion, would eventually transform hepatocytes to HCC tumor cells. Therefore, this chapter focuses on reviewing the virologic role of HCV in disease progression, as well as the host genetic changes for HCC development. Besides, the oncogenic mechanisms evoked by HCV at cellular level and the sex disparity of HCV-related HCC based on sex hormone effects are discussed individually. The comprehensive understanding of HCV-induced hepatocarcinogenesis paves the way to develop novel prophylactic or therapeutic strategies for HCC in future.},

abstract = {The global risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been largely driven by hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection for the past century, along with hepatitis C virus (HCV), aflatoxin, excessive alcohol consumption, and obesity/diabetes. The dominant effect of HBV on global HCC risk should decline as the population vaccinated against HBV grows older. Infection with HCV is also expected to decline. Projections of HCV-related HCC rates remaining high for another 30 years may be overly pessimistic. Alcohol may be less of a factor in HCC in coming years. However, obesity and diabetes may become even more important risk factors for HCC. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {Cholangiocarcinoma (CC) is the second most common primary hepatic malignancy after hepatocellular cancer. CC accounts for approximately 10{\%}-25{\%} of all hepatobiliary malignancies. There are considerable geographic and demographic variations in the incidence of CC. There are several established risk factors for CC, including parasitic infections, primary sclerosing cholangitis, biliary-duct cysts, hepatolithiasis, and toxins. Other less-established potential risk factors include inflammatory bowel disease, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, cirrhosis, diabetes, obesity, alcohol drinking, tobacco smoking, and host genetic polymorphisms. In studies where the distinction between intra- and extrahepatic CC was used, some potential risk factors seem to have a differential effect on CC, depending on the site. Therefore, the consistent use of a more refined classification would allow a better understanding of risk factors for CC. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: Well established risk factors for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma such as biliary tract inflammation and liver flukes are not present in most Western countries patients. Although cirrhosis and other causes of chronic liver disease have been implicated, their contribution as risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma is unclear and our aims were to analyze these emerging potential risk factors by systematic examination of case-control series from geographically diverse regions. Methods: We performed a literature review and meta-analysis of case-control studies on intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and cirrhosis and related risk factors. Tests of heterogeneity, publication bias and sensitivity analyses were performed and an overall odds ratio and 95{\%} confidence intervals calculated. Results: Eleven studies from both high and low prevalence regions were identified. All studies except those evaluating cirrhosis, diabetes, and obesity exhibited significant heterogeneity. Cirrhosis was associated with a combined OR of 22.92 (95{\%} CI = 18.24-28.79). Meta-analysis estimated the overall odds ratio (with 95{\%} confidence intervals) for defined risk factors such as hepatitis B: 5.10 (2.91-8.95), hepatitis C: 4.84 (2.41-9.71), obesity: 1.56 (1.26-1.94), diabetes mellitus type II: 1.89 (1.74-2.07), smoking: 1.31 (0.95-1.82), and alcohol use: 2.81 (1.52-5.21). Sensitivity analysis did not alter the odds ratio for any risk factors except smoking and there was no evidence of publication bias. Conclusions: Cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B and C, alcohol use, diabetes, and obesity are major risk factors for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. These data suggest a common pathogenesis of primary intrahepatic epithelial cancers. {\textcopyright} 2012 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The major risk factors and etiological agents responsible for development of hepatocellular carcinoma in humans have been identified and characterized. Among these are chronic infection with hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus, exposure to aflatoxin B1, and cirrhosis of any etiology (including alcoholic cirrhosis and cirrhosis associated with genetic liver diseases). Both chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis represent major preneoplastic conditions of the liver as the majority of hepatocellular carcinomas arise in these pathological settings. Hepatocarcinogenesis represents a linear and progressive process in which successively more aberrant monoclonal populations of hepatocytes evolve. Regenerative hepatocytes in focal lesions in the inflamed liver (chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis) give rise to hyperplastic hepatocyte nodules, and these progress to dysplastic nodules, which are thought to be the direct precursor of hepatocellular carcinoma. In most cases, the neoplastic transformation of hepatocytes results from accumulation of genetic damage during the repetitive cellular proliferation that occurs in the injured liver in response to paracrine growth factor and cytokine stimulation. Hepatocellular carcinomas exhibit numerous genetic abnormalities (including chromosomal deletions, rearrangements, aneuploidy, gene amplifications, and mutations), as well as epigenetic alterations (including modulation of DNA methylation). These genetic and epigenetic alterations combine to activate positive mediators of cellular proliferation (including cellular proto-oncogenes and their mitogenic signaling pathways) and inactivate negative mediators of cellular proliferation (including tumor suppressor genes), resulting in cells with autonomous growth potential. However, hepatocellular carcinomas exhibit a high degree of genetic heterogeneity, suggesting that multiple molecular pathways may be involved in the genesis of subsets of hepatocellular neoplasms. Continued investigation of the mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis will refine our current understanding of the molecular and cellular basis for neoplastic transformation in liver, enabling the development of effective strategies for prevention and/or more effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.},

abstract = {It has been established that small, equivocal nodular lesions such as dysplastic nodules (DNs) and small well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas (early HCCs) are frequently observed in noncancerous liver tissues resected along with HCCs and in explant cirrhotic livers. DNs are classified into low-grade DNs or high-grade DNs on the basis of cytological and architectural atypia; high-grade DNs show varying degrees of cytological or architectural atypia, or both. Early HCCs are indistinctly nodular and highly differentiated and are frequently difficult to differentiate from high-grade DNs. Although the pathological diagnosis of high-grade DNs and early HCCs is controversial, the presence of tumor cell invasion into the intratumoral portal tracts (stromal invasion) is a helpful clue for differentiating early HCC from high-grade DNs. It is highly suggested that many HCCs occurring in cirrhotic liver arise in DNs and develop to classical HCC in a multistep fashion.

abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the hemodynamics and the main drainage vessel of hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Single level dynamic computed tomography during hepatic arteriography (CTHA) was performed in 32 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Carcinoma was confirmed with histologic (n = 9), or clinical (n = 23) examination results. Single level CTHA findings were retrospectively analyzed. Histologic specimens from 40 livers with hepatocellular carcinoma were also examined with special attention to vessels along the rim of the lesion. RESULTS: Contrast material enhancement on single level CTHA images occurred in four phases (a) inflow of the contrast material into tumor; (b) tumor enhancement, (c) inflow of the contrast material into adjacent liver, and (d) corona enhancement of adjacent liver. Corona enhancement was seen in all lesions. A bright branching structure in the corona enhancement area, suggestive of a portal venule was visible at the start of adjacent liver staining in 21 lesions. Continuity between a tumor sinusoid and a tiny vessel in the inner layer of the pseudocapsule was histologically confirmed in 10 or 40 specimens. Continuity between a tiny vessel in the inner layer and a portal vein in the outer layer of the pseudocapsule was confirmed with findings on serial sections from one liver. CONCLUSION: The main drainage of hepatocellular carcinoma lesions may be a portal venule.},

abstract = {To understand the hemodynamics of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is important for the precise imaging diagnosis and treatment, because there is an intense correlation between their hemodynamics and pathophysiology. Angiogenesis such as sinusoidal capillarization and unpaired arteries shows gradual increase during multi-step hepatocarcinogenesis from high-grade dysplastic nodule to classic hypervascular HCC. In accordance with this angiogenesis, the intranodular portal supply is decreased, whereas the intranodular arterial supply is first decreased during the early stage of hepatocarcinogenesis and then increased in parallel with increasing grade of malignancy of the nodules. On the other hand, the main drainage vessels of hepatocellular nodules change from hepatic veins to hepatic sinusoids and then to portal veins during multi-step hepatocarcinogenesis, mainly due to disappearance of the hepatic veins from the nodules. Therefore, in early HCC, no perinodular corona enhancement is seen on portal to equilibrium phase CT, but it is definite in hypervascular classical HCC. Corona enhancement is thicker in encapsulated HCC and thin in HCC without pseudocapsule. To understand these hemodynamic changes during multi-step hepatocarcinogenesis is important, especially for early diagnosis and treatment of HCCs. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author(s).},

abstract = {One hundred eighty‐nine surgically resected hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) were analyzed to study tumor encapsulation and the pathologic features that might account for the better prognosis in relation to it, and to examine the prognostic and pathobiologic significance of capsular thickness. Tumor encapsulation was found in 72 (46.8{\%}) of the 154 cases with adequate histologic sections of the tumor‐nontumor junctions. Encapsulated tumors showed a much lower incidence of direct liver invasion (P {\textless} 0.0001), tumor microsatellites (P {\textless} 0.0001), and venous permeation (P = 0.02) when compared with non‐encapsulated ones. Significantly better disease‐free and actuarial survival times were observed in patients with encapsulated tumors (medians, 9.9 and 18.3 months, respectively), compared with those with nonencapsulated ones (medians, 4.0 and 5.9 months, respectively; P = 0.0001 and 0.001, respectively). The incidence of tumor encapsulation did not increase or decrease with tumor size. Tumor encapsulation did not correlate with the presence of cirrhosis or the abundance of tumor stroma, suggesting that formation of the tumor capsule was independent of the degree of fibrosis within and outside the tumor, Among the 72 cases of encapsulated HCC, the capsular thickness ranged from 0.13 to 3.09 mm (mean ± standard deviation = 0.87 ± 0.59 mm), and it was unrelated to tumor size or presence of cirrhosis. Although it was apparent that a lower extensive tumor invasiveness contributed significantly to the better prognosis in encapsulated HCC, there was no correlation between capsular thickness and liver invasion, microsatellites, venous permeation, or survivals. Therefore, the thickness of tumor capsules was not helpful in prognostication. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1992 American Cancer Society},

abstract = {Background/Aims: Fatty change is frequently observed in small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of the early stage. However, the mechanism of fatty change and its pathomorphological features in small HCC are not yet fully understood. These issues are addressed here. Methods: Histological examinations were conducted on 260 HCC nodules (≤3 cm in diameter) which were surgically obtained from 249 patients. According to the distribution pattern, fatty changes were classified into two types: 'diffuse type' when the change was found throughout the cancerous nodule; and 'focal type' when the change was localized in part of the nodule. To study the pathogenesis of fatty change in HCC in relation to angioarchitectures the number of arterial tumor vessels and intratumoral portal tracts in 104 of the 260 nodules was counted. Results: Fatty change was found in 51 of the 269 nodules (19.6{\%}), the frequency was highest (36.4{\%}) in the nodules whose diameter was 1.1 {\~{}} 1.5 cm, and the frequency decreased with the increase in tumor diameter. Small well-differentiated HCCs were often associated with a diffuse type fatty change. With the increase in tumor diameter, moderately differentiated cancerous tissues without associated fatty change appeared, and the focal type was found more frequently. According to the angioarchitecture, in HCCs ≤1.5 cm, the number of intratumoral arteries was significantly smaller in HCCs with fatty change (p {\textless} O.05), though the number of intratumoral portal tracts was not significantly different compared-with HCCs without fatty change. Conclusion: These findings suggest that fatty change of small HCC is closely related to the tumor size, the histological grade and insufficient development of the arterial tumor vessels.},

Data extraction was performed using a custom designed data extraction form. Results: A total of 12,344 references were identified. Duplicates, 1,597, were excluded. Clearly irrelevant references, 10,676, were excluded through reading titles and abstracts. Some references (59) were excluded by applying the exclusion criteria. Twelve studies including 646 patients and measuring iron content (8), copper content (11), zinc (9), and selenium (2) qualified for the review. Although a meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity between the studies, a clear pattern of distribution of the trace elements was discernible. Conclusion: Iron and zinc content are lower in HCC than in surrounding tissues or normal controls. Copper content is lower in HCC than in surrounding tissues and cirrhotic controls. Epidemiological and physiological reasons for the trace element alterations should be further investigated. {\textcopyright} Humana Press Inc. 2007.},

abstract = {Objectives: To clarify the changes in organic anion-transporting polypeptide 8 (OATP8) expression and enhancement ratio on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging in hepatocellular nodules during multistep hepatocarcinogenesis. Methods: In imaging analysis, we focused on 71 surgically resected hepatocellular carcinomas (well, moderately and poorly differentiated HCCs) and 1 dysplastic nodule (DN). We examined the enhancement ratio in the hepatobiliary phase of gadoxetic acid enhanced MR imaging [(1/postcontrast T1 value-1/precontrast T1 value)/(1/precontrast T1 value)], then analysed the correlation among the enhancement ratio, tumour differentiation grade and intensity of immunohistochemical OATP8 expression. In pathological analysis, we focused on surgically resected 190 hepatocellular nodules: low-grade DNs, high-grade DNs, early HCCs, well-differentiated, moderately differentiated and poorly differentiated HCCs, including cases without gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging. We evaluated the correlation between the immunohistochemical OATP8 expression and the tumour differentiation grade. Results: The enhancement ratio of HCCs decreased in accordance with the decline in tumour differentiation (P{\textless}0.0001, R=0.28) and with the decline of OATP8 expression (P{\textless}0.0001, R=0.81). The immunohistochemical OATP8 expression decreased from low-grade DNs to poorly differentiated HCCs (P{\textless}0.0001, R=0.15).

Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and patient informed consent for research use of the resected specimen was obtained. MR images in 25 patients (20 men, five women; mean age, 68 years; range, 49-82 years) with 27 resected hypervascular HCCs (one well, 13 moderately, 13 poorly differentiated) that demonstrated hepatocyte-selective enhancement on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR images, were quantitatively studied, and findings were correlated with results of immunohistochemical staining for a sinusoidal transporter, organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 (OATP1B1) and/or OATP1B3 (OATP1B1 and/or -1B3 ), and a canalicular transporter, multidrug resistance -associated protein 2 (MRP2), and also with bile accumulation in tumors. Statistical analysis was performed with the Student t test and Scheff{\'{e}} post hoc test. Results: Combined with positive OATP1B1 and/or -1B3 expression (O+), two patterns of MRP2 expression contributed to high enhancement: decreased expression (M-, n = 3) and increased expression at the luminal membrane of pseudoglands (M+[P], n = 3). Nodules without OATP1B1 and/or -1B3 expression (O-, n = 13) and nodules with O+ associated with increased MRP2 expression only at the canaliculi (M+[C], n = 8) induced significantly lower enhancement than those with the two expression patterns described before (O+/M- group vs O- group, P = .002; O+/M- group vs O+/M+[C] group, P = .047; O+/M+[P] group vs O- group, P {\textless} .001; O+/M+[P] group vs O+/M+[C] group, P {\textless} .001). Nodules with bile pigment (n = 12) showed significantly higher enhancement (P = .004); all five nodules (one well differentiated HCC, four moderately differentiated HCCs), which were enhanced more than adjacent liver parenchyma, contained bile pigment. Conclusion: High hepatocyte-selective enhancement is induced by expression patterns of transporters, which may result in accumulation of gadoxetic acid in cytoplasm of tumor cells or in lumina of pseudoglands. An HCC with gadoxetic acid enhancement is characterized by bile accumulation in tumors. {\textcopyright} RSNA, 2010.},

abstract = {Background/Aims: Recurrence due to clinically undetectable intrahepatic metastasis and portal vein invasion of HCC cells is not 'uncommon' even in small HCCs. The present study investigated the relationship between these factors and macroscopic types of HCC. Methods: Surgically resected 209 cases of small HCC less than 3 cm in diameter were examined. Macroscopically, 209 cases were divided into 'vaguely nodular type', 'single nodular type', 'single nodular type with extranodular growth' and 'confluent multinodular type'. Results: None of the vaguely nodular type had intrahepatic metastasis or portal vein invasion, and their diameter was significantly smaller than the other three types. 'Single nodular type with extranodular growth' and 'confluent multinodular type' show higher frequency of portal vein invasion and intrahepatic metastases than 'single nodular type'. Among 149 metastatic lesions, the distance was 10 mm or shorter in 118 (79.2{\%}). Conclusions: It is important to precisely determine the gross type of small HCC by diagnostic imaging in order to predict portal vein invasion and micrometastasis. It is also important to ablate the tumor with enough surrounding tissue 1 cm in width at least to prevent the recurrence from those micrometastasis. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

@article{Okuda1997,
abstract = {The histopathology and clinical picture of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) varies between individual patients and regions. These variations are perhaps due to differences in the genetic alterations that precede hepatocarcinogenesis. In this study, the clinicopathological features of HCC were compared between southern African blacks and Japanese, indicating large differences in the frequency of underlying cirrhosis, grade of cancer cell differentiation and clinical course. Intra-abdominal bleeding and febrile, rapidly progressive HCC are more common among blacks. Such a difference is accounted for, in part, by frequent encapsulation of the turnout which is well differentiated, and grows slowly in an expanding fashion in Japan. Encapsulated HCC was not seen among the black patients studied. Other distinct clinicopathological types discussed in this paper include diffuse- type HCC which is usually caused by multiple portal spread occurring almost simultaneously; the clinical course is fulminant. Sclerosing carcinoma is frequently associated with hypercalcaemia in the United States, but not in Japan. Fibrolamellar carcinoma is nearly non-existent in Asia, whereas it is common among young adults in the West. Its prognosis is generally better than ordinary HCC. Hepatocellular carcinoma has a strong propensity to invade vessel and duct systems. Portal invasion does not produce distinct clinical signs although it may aggravate portal hypertension. Patients with tumour occlusion in the major portal vein may give rise to ischaemic hepatitis when blood pressure drops suddenly in the preterminal stage. Liver parenchyma develops submassive necrosis and clinically there is an acute rise in alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Invasion into a major hepatic vein and the inferior vena cava also occurs, but less frequently compared with portal invasion. The patient can live even with a turnout thrombus in the atrium crossing the tricuspid valves. Intraductal invasion causes acute jaundice as well as an occasional haemobilia with pain. We recently found that a distinct pathological type called 'extrahepatic growth' or 'pedunculated HCC' develops as a result of fusion of right-sided adrenal metastasis of HCC and the liver, perhaps through the 'adreno-hepatic fusion' which is rather common in cirrhotic livers.},

@article{Llovet2004,
abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common neoplasm in the world, and the third most common cause of cancer-related death. It affects mainly patients with cirrhosis of any etiology. Patients with cirrhosis are thus usually included in surveillance plans aiming to achieve early detection and effective treatment. Only patients who would be treated if diagnosed with HCC should undergo surveillance, which is based on ultrasonography and $\alpha$-fetoprotein every 6 months. Upon diagnosis, the patients have to be staged to define tumor extent and liver function impairment. Thereafter, the best treatment option can be indicated and a prognosis estimate can be established. The present manuscript depicts the Barcelona-Cl{\'{i}}nic Liver Cancer Group diagnostic and treatment strategy. This is based on the analysis of several cohort and randomized controlled studies that have allowed the continuous refinement of treatment indication and application. Surgical resection is considered the first treatment option for early stage patients. It is reserved for patients with solitary tumors without portal hypertension and normal bilirubin. If these conditions are not met, patients are considered for liver transplantation (cadaveric or live donation) or percutaneous ablation if at an early stage (solitary ≤ 5 cm or up to 3 nodules ≤ 3 cm). These patients will reach a 5-year survival between 50 and 75{\%}. If patients are diagnosed at an intermediate stage and are still asymptomatic and have preserved liver function, they may benefit from chemoembolization. Their 3-year survival will exceed 50{\%}. There is no effective treatment for patients with advanced disease and thus, in such instances, the patients have to be considered for research trials with new therapeutic options. Finally, patients with end-stage disease should receive only palliative treatment to avoid unnecessary suffering.

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to conduct a comprehensive study of the clinical correlation between the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level at diagnosis and pathological grades, progression, and survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of 78,743 patients in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER)-registered HCC was analyzed. The AFP test results for patients with HCC were mainly recorded as AFP-negative and AFP-positive. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the AFP level at diagnosis was an independent risk factor of pathological grade (odds ratio [OR], 2.559; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 2.075-3.157; P {\textless} 0.001), TNM-7 stage (OR, 2.794; CI, 2.407-3.242; P {\textless} 0.001), and tumor size (OR, 1.748; 95{\%} CI, 1.574-1.941; P {\textless} 0.001). Multivariable Cox regression analyses identified AFP level as an independent predictor of survival risk of patients with HCC who did not undergo surgery (hazard ratio [HR], 1.660; 95{\%} CI, 1.534-1.797; P {\textless} 0.001), and those who underwent surgery (HR, 1.534; 95{\%} CI, 1.348-1.745; P {\textless} 0.001).

@article{Regev2002,
abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Needle liver biopsy has been shown to have a high rate of sampling error in patients with diffuse parenchymal liver diseases. In these cases, the sample of liver tissue does not reflect the true degree of inflammation, fibrosis, or cirrhosis, despite an adequate sample size. The aim of this study was to determine the rate and extent of sampling error in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection, and to assess the intraobserver variation with the commonly used scoring system proposed by Scheuer and modified by Batts and Ludwig. METHODS: A total of 124 patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection underwent simultaneous laparoscopy-guided biopsies of the right and left hepatic lobes. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and with trichrome. The slides were blindly coded and randomly divided among two hepatopathologists. Inflammation and fibrosis were scored according to the standard grading (inflammation) and staging (fibrosis) method based on the modified Scheuer system. Following the interpretation, the slides were uncoded to compare the results of the right and left lobes. Fifty of the samples were blindly resubmitted to each of the pathologists to determine the intraobserver variation. RESULTS: Thirty of 124 patients (24.2{\%}) had a difference of at least one grade, and 41 of 124 patients (33.1{\%}) had a difference of at least one stage between the right and left lobes. In 18 patients (14.5{\%}), interpretation of cirrhosis was given in one lobe, whereas stage 3 fibrosis was given in the other. A difference of two stages or two grades was found in only three (2.4{\%}) and two (1.6{\%}) patients, respectively. Of the 50 samples that were examined twice, the grading by each pathologist on the second examination differed from the first examination in 0{\%} and 4{\%}, and the staging differed in 6{\%} and 10{\%}, respectively. All observed variations were of one grade or one stage. CONCLUSIONS: Liver biopsy samples taken from the right and left hepatic lobes differed in histological grading and staging in a large proportion of chronic hepatitis C virus patients; however, differences of more than one stage or grade were uncommon. A sampling error may have led to underdiagnosis of cirrhosis in 14.5{\%} of the patients. These differences could not be attributed to intraobserver variation, which appeared to be low. {\textcopyright} 2002 by Am. Coll. of Gastroenterology.},

abstract = {Background/Aims: In chronic viral hepatitis, liver biopsy is performed for assessing disease activity and fibrosis. In this study, we evaluated the impact of the size of liver biopsy on the grading and staging. Methods: We selected 161 liver biopsies from patients with chronic types B and C hepatitis on the basis of their length (≥ 3 cm) and width (1.4 mm). Ishak scoring system was used for grading and staging. The score was blindly repeated reducing the length of the specimen from ≥ 3 to 1.5 cm and to 1 cm long and width from 1.4 to 1 mm. Results: Reducing the length of the biopsy led to an increase of cases with mild grades: 49.7{\%} in ≥ 3 cm, 60.2{\%} in 1.5 cm and 86.6{\%} in 1 cm long specimens (P {\textless} 0.001). Similarly, cases staged as having mild fibrosis significantly increased in the shorter specimens: 59{\%} in ≥ 3 cm, 68.3{\%} in 1.5 cm and 80.1{\%} in 1 cm long specimens (P {\textless} 0.001). As for the width, both grade and stage were significantly underscored in the 1 mm samples, regardless of their length. Conclusions: Liver biopsy size strongly influences the grading and staging of chronic viral hepatitis.

Patients were randomly assigned to self-administrate from a facial mask with a demand valve, for 5 min before and during biopsy, either a breathing mixture of 50{\%} N2O/O2 (N2O group, n = 51), or a breathing oxygen placebo (P group, n = 49). Liver biopsy was performed at bedside after adequate local anesthesia with xylocaine. At the end of the procedure, patients were asked to self-evaluate pain experienced using a visual analogue scale (VAS) with scoring from 0 to 100 mm.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: N2O/O2 administration resulted in the absence of pain in a significantly higher number of patients treated than in patients of the P group: 19 versus 2, respectively (p = 0.0001).

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: Although percutaneous liver biopsy is a standard diagnostic procedure, it has drawbacks, including risk of serious complications. It is not known whether persons with advanced chronic liver disease have a greater risk of complications from liver biopsy than patients with more mild, chronic liver disease. The safety and complications of liver biopsy were examined in patients with hepatitis C-related bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis who were enrolled in the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-Term Treatment against Cirrhosis trial. Methods: Standard case report forms from 2740 liver biopsies performed at 10 study sites between 2000 and 2006 were reviewed for serious adverse events, together with information from questionnaires completed by investigators about details of biopsy techniques used at each hospital. Results: There were 29 serious adverse events (1.1{\%}); the most common was bleeding (16 cases; 0.6{\%}). There were no biopsy-related deaths. The bleeding rate was higher among patients with platelet counts of 60,000/mm3 or less and among those with an international normalized ratio of 1.3 or greater, although none of the patients with an international normalized ratio greater than 1.5 bled. Excluding subjects with a platelet count of 60,000/mm3 or less would have reduced the bleeding rate by 25{\%} (4 of 16), eliminating only 2.8{\%} (77 of 2740) of biopsies. Operator experience, the type of needle used, or the performance of the biopsy under ultrasound guidance did not influence the frequencies of adverse events.

abstract = {Liver biopsy is used as the “gold standard” for the assessment of the stage and degree of activity in chronic hepatitis C and is of major importance in evaluating the effects of treatment. Because numerous therapeutic trials are undertaken with histological control, the reproducibility of liver biopsy interpretation appears essential. Therefore the aim of this study was to estimate intraobserver and interobserver variations in the assessment of features, classification, and numerical scoring of chronic viral hepatitis C among 10 pathologists specializing in liver diseases. These pathologists independently reviewed 30 liver biopsy specimens of viral hepatitis C and completed a histological form for each of the specimens. Five pairs of pathologists then were randomly designated. They independently reviewed the biopsy specimens and filled out a new coding form. The interobserver variation was calculated for each item among the 10 individuals and then among the five pairs with the intraclass correlation coefficient or ϰ statistics. Five features showed an almost perfect or a substantial degree of concordance among the 10 observers (i.e., cirrhosis, fibrosis, fibrosis grading of Knodell index, steatosis, portal lymphoid aggregates). The 17 other indicators showed a weaker concordance with, for instance, a moderate degree of concordance for piecemeal necrosis, disease activity, Knodell index, a fair degree of concordance for lobular necrosis, and only a slight degree of concordance for six items. Five items had a higher concordance when viewed by a pair of pathologists than when studied by only one pathologist (i.e., steatosis, periportal necrosis grading of Knodell index, lobular necrosis grading of Knodell index, centrilobular fibrosis, and ductular proliferation). Two showed a significant decrease, and the others were unchanged. This study reveals that certain features of major importance in assessing disease activity show significant observer variation. The acceptable degree of concordance of the Knodell index was related mainly to the substantial degree of concordance of the fibrosis score, whereas other numerical items displayed substantial observer variations. Simultaneous observation by two pathologists increased the reproducibility of numerical scoring and of certain viral hepatitis C lesions. A classification of chronic hepatitis C based on dissociated semiquantitative assessment of necroinflammatory lesions and fibrosis offered more reproducibility than the use of a global numerical index.

abstract = {Background: A new definition of infiltration to the capsule (fc-inf) has been proposed as a novel marker for predicting the prognosis of 88 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The current aim was to present evidence to develop the fibrous capsule and fc-inf, from the Japanese histological findings for HCC, and to validate their biological significances and predictive power of survival in a large series. Methods: A total of 365 HCCs were divided into HCCs without the fibrous capsule (NC type; n = 135) and HCCs with the fibrous capsule (FC type; n = 230). Then, FC type was subclassified into two types: extracapsular infiltrating (EC) type (n = 125), in which cancer cells penetrated outside the fibrous capsule, and intracapsular (IC) type (n = 105), in which the infiltrating cancer cells stayed inside the fibrous capsule. Results: The proportion of less histological differentiation and portal venous invasion was higher in FC type than in NC type. The fibrous capsule came to be observed according to the increase of tumor size (P {\textless} 0.0001). FC type had significantly poorer outcome for overall survival than NC type (P = 0.0022). EC type showed more intrahepatic metastasis than IC type. The macroscopic subclassifications were significantly affected the presence of fc-inf. EC type had significantly poorer outcome for disease-free survival than IC type (P = 0.0132) and was an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival (P = 0.0482). Conclusions: Fc-inf defined as extracapsular penetration was verified to be a novel marker for predicting prognosis, and presence of fc-inf might be predicted by tumor gross features. {\textcopyright} 2009 Society of Surgical Oncology.},

abstract = {Background. Because of the high incidence of recurrent tumor, many surgeons have become disenchanted with transplantation as a treatment for cholangiocarcinoma. Methods. The Cincinnati Transplant Tumor Registry database was used to examine 207 patients who underwent liver transplantation for otherwise unresectable cholangiocarcinoma or cholangiohepatoma. Specific factors evaluated included tumor size, presence of multiple nodules, evidence of tumor spread at surgery, and treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Incidentally found tumors were compared to tumors that were known or suspected to be present before transplantation. Results. The 1, 2, and 5-year survival estimates using life table analysis were 72, 48, and 23{\%}. Fifty-one percent of patients had recurrence of their tumors after transplantation and 84{\%} of recurrences occurred within 2 years of transplantation. Survival after recurrence was rarely more than 1 year. Forty-seven percent of recurrences occurred in the allograft and 30{\%} in the lungs. Tumor recurrence, and evidence of tumor spread at the time of surgery, were negative prognostic variables. There were no positive prognostic variables. Patients with incidentally found cholangiocarcinomas did not have improved survival over patients with known or suspected tumors. A small number of patients survived for more than 5 years without recurrence. However, this group had no variable in common that would aid in the selection of similar patients in the future. Conclusions. Because of the high rate of recurrent tumor and lack of positive prognostic variables, transplantation should seldom be used as a treatment for cholangiocarcinoma.

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cholangiocarcinoma is an enigmatic malignancy of the biliary tract that has recently been shown to be increasing in incidence globally. There has been recent progress in identifying potential risk factors for the tumor, and in the use of emerging technologies for diagnosis and palliative treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: Hepatitis B and C, cirrhosis and alcohol have been described as risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma. A morphology-based classification for cholangiocarcinoma is proposed that will facilitate future descriptive epidemiology, diagnosis and comparative therapeutic studies. Diagnosis may be improved by new approaches to enhance the diagnostic yield and utility of biliary cytology. The role of new imaging approaches such as positron emission tomography scanning, endoscopic ultrasound or optical coherence tomography for diagnosis are being examined and defined. Long-term results for transplantation protocols for curative intent in non-resectable localized disease have been described. Photodynamic therapy looks extremely promising for adjunct therapy of intrahepatic mass lesions. SUMMARY: Recent advances in the epidemiology, classification, diagnosis and therapy of cholangiocarcinoma are expected to enhance the evaluation and management of patients with this devastating malignancy. {\textcopyright} 2006 Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

Variable selection plays a pivotal role in contemporary statistical learning and scientific discoveries. The traditional idea of best subset selection methods, which can be regarded as a specific form of pe-nalized likelihood, is computationally too expensive for many modern statistical applications. Other forms of penalized likelihood methods have been successfully developed over the last decade to cope with high dimensionality. They have been widely applied for simultaneously selecting important variables and estimating their effects in high dimensional statistical inference. In this article, we present a brief ac-count of the recent developments of theory, methods, and implementations for high dimensional variable selection. What limits of the dimensionality such methods can handle, what the role of penalty functions is, and what the statistical properties are rapidly drive the advances of the field. The properties of non-concave penalized likelihood and its roles in high dimensional statistical modeling are emphasized. We also review some recent advances in ultra-high dimensional variable selection, with emphasis on independence screening and two-scale methods.},

abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer worldwide that primarily develops in cirrhosis resulting from chronic infection by hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, alcoholic injury, and to a lesser extent from genetically determined disorders such as hemochromatosis. HCC has recently been linked to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the hepatic manifestation of obesity and related metabolic disorders such as diabetes. This association is alarming due to the globally high prevalence of these conditions and may contribute to the rising incidence of HCC witnessed in many industrialized countries. There is also evidence that NAFLD acts synergistically with other risk factors of HCC such as chronic hepatitis C and alcoholic liver injury. Moreover, HCC may complicate non-cirrhotic NAFLD with mild or absent fibrosis, greatly expanding the population potentially at higher risk. Major systemic and liver-specific molecular mechanisms involved include insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, increased TNF signaling pathways, and alterations in cellular lipid metabolism. These provide new targets for prevention, early recognition, and effective treatment of HCC associated with NAFLD. Indeed, both metformin and PPAR gamma agonists have been associated with lower risk and improved prognosis of HCC. This review summarizes current evidence as it pertains to the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and prevention of NAFLD-associated HCC. {\textcopyright} 2012 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

We review potential applications, protocol optimization strategies, as well as diagnostic pitfalls. A variety of illustrative case examples will be used to demonstrate the role of these agents in detection and characterization of liver lesions as well as for imaging the biliary system. Changes in MR protocols geared toward optimizing workflow and imaging quality are also discussed.

With the newest generation of 40-64 row scanners, true isotropic imaging with a z-axis resolution of 0,3-0.6 mm has become possible. Acquisition time for the scan has been shortened to a few seconds. To fully exploit the advantages of MDCT scanners in liver imaging, the examination protocols have to be optimized with regard to contrast material flow rate, scan delay, and the number of scans performed. The possible advantages of double arterial phase scans in the detection of HCC are discussed. The clinical value of 3D reconstructions, such as multiplanar reconstructions and curved planar reconstructions, for assessment of the vascular and biliary duct infiltration is demonstrated.

abstract = {Aim: To elucidate the pre-treatment clinical and imaging findings affecting the tumor response to the transcatheter treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: Two hundred cirrhotic patients with HCC received a total of 425 transcatheter treatments. The tumor response was evaluated by helical CT and a massive necrosis (MN) was defined as a necrosis {\textgreater} 90{\%}. Twenty-five clinical and imaging variables were analyzed: uninodular/ multinodular HCC, unilobar/bilobar, tumor capsula, hypervascular lesion, portal vein thrombosis, portal hypertension, ascites, platelets count, aspartate transaminases/alanine transaminases (AST/ALT), alfafetoprotein (AFP) {\textgreater} 100, AFP {\textgreater} 400, serum creatinine, virus hepatitis C (VHC) cirrhosis, performance status, age, Okuda stage, Child-Pugg stage, sex, CLIP (Cancer of the Liver Italian Program) score, serum bilirubin, constitutional syndrome, serum albumine, prothrombin activity, BCLC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer) stage. Prognostic factors of response were subjected to univariate analysis and thereafter, when significant, to the multivariate analyses. Results: On imaging analysis, complete response was obtained in 60 (30{\%}) patients, necrosis {\textgreater} 90{\%} in 38 (19{\%}) patients, necrosis {\textgreater} 50{\%} in 44 (22{\%}) patients, and necrosis {\textless} 50{\%} in 58 (29{\%}) patients. Ninety-eight (49{\%}) of the 200 patients were considered to have a MN. In univariate analysis, significant variables (P {\textless} 0.01) were: uninodular tumor, unilobar, tumor size 2-6 cm, CLIP score {\textless} 2, absence of constitutional syndrome, and BCLC stage {\textless} 2. In a multivariate analysis, the variables reaching statistical significance were: presence of tumor capsule (P {\textless} 0.0001), tumor size 2-6 cm (P {\textless} 0.03), CLIP score {\textless} 2 (P {\textless} 0.006), and absence of constitutional syndrome (P {\textless} 0.03). Kaplan-Mayer cumulative survival at 12 mo was 80{\%} at 24 mo was 56{\%}. MN was associated with a longer survival (P {\textless} 0.0001). Conclusion: MN after transcatheter treatment is more common in the presence of tumor capsule, maximum diameter of the main lesion between 2 and 6 cm, CLIP score {\textless} 2 and absence of constitutional syndrome. The ability to predict which patients will respond to transcatheter treatment may be useful in the clinical decision-making process, and in stratifying the randomization of patients in clinical trials. {\textcopyright} 2007 WJG.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to define the optimal scan window for acquiring arterial phase images in the detection of hypervascular hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). MATERIALS AND METHODS. Biphasic arterial phase CT examinations were performed using a 16-MDCT scanner on 198 patients (159 men and 39 women; mean age, 59 years; age range, 25-82 years) with nodular HCC. All examinations were performed after administering 120-150 mL of a nonionic contrast media (370 mg I/mL) at a rate of 3-4 mL/s. The scan delay - the interval between when the bolus-tracking program detected the threshold enhancement of 100 H in the abdominal aorta and the start of the first arterial scan - was progressively lengthened by 2-second intervals, from 10 seconds in group 1 to 20 seconds in group 6. The second arterial phase scan was started 6 seconds after the end of the early scan. A tube collimation of 1.5 mm, a table feed of 18 mm per rotation, an image thickness of 3 mm, and 3-mm increments were used. The duration of each phase scan was 4.5-8.8 seconds. Tumor-to-liver attenuation difference (TLAD) at the first (TLAD1) and second (TLAD2) arterial phase images were compared lesion by lesion. Four observers assigned subjective ratings of visual conspicuity and individual preferences for each phase in each group. RESULTS. The mean threshold time (100 H) was 18.4 ± 3.1 seconds, and 97{\%} of patients were within the range of 13-24 seconds. The mean TLAD1 of groups 3 to 6 and the mean TLAD2 of groups 1 to 5 were all comparable; they were also all significantly (p {\textless} 0.005) higher than the mean TLAD1 of groups 1 and 2 and the mean TLAD2 of group 6. In groups 1 and 2, the mean TLAD2 was significantly higher than the mean TLAD1 (p {\textless} 0.001); in groups 5 and 6, the mean TLAD1 was significantly higher than the mean TLAD2 (p {\textless} 0.001). In groups 3 and 4, the mean TLAD1 and TLAD2 were similar. The visual conspicuity and individual preferences were higher for the first-phase image in groups 3 to 6 and the second-phase image in groups 1 and 2. CONCLUSION. The optimal scan window for arterial phase images in the detection of HCC seems to be approximately 14-30 seconds from the 100-H threshold. {\textcopyright} American Roentgen Ray Society.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine, by using multi-detector row helical computed tomography (CT), the added value of obtaining unenhanced and delayed phase scans in addition to biphasic (hepatic arterial and portal venous phases) scans in the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with cirrhosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Local ethical committee approval and patient consent were obtained. One hundred ninety-five patients (129 men, 66 women; mean age, 61 years; age range, 39-78 years) with 250 HCCs underwent multidetector row helical CT of the liver. A quadruple-phase protocol that included unenhanced, hepatic arterial, portal venous, and delayed phases was performed. Analysis of images from hepatic arterial and portal venous phases combined, hepatic arterial and portal venous phases with the unenhanced phase, hepatic arterial and portal venous phases with the delayed phase, and all phases combined was performed separately by three independent radiologists. Relative sensitivity, positive predictive value, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Az) were calculated for each reading session. RESULTS: Mean sensitivity and positive predictive values, respectively, for HCC detection were 88.8{\%} (666 of 750 readings) and 97.8{\%} (666 of 681 readings) for the combined hepatic arterial and portal venous phases, 89.2{\%} (669 of 750 readings) and 97.8{\%} (669 of 684 readings) for hepatic arterial and portal venous phases with the unenhanced phase, 92.8{\%} (696 of 750 readings) and 97.3{\%} (696 of 715 readings) for hepatic arterial and portal venous phases with the delayed phase, and 92.8{\%} (696 of 750 readings) and 97.3{\%} (696 of 715 readings) for all four phases combined. The reading sessions in which delayed phase images were available for interpretation showed significantly (P {\textless} .05) superior sensitivity and A z values. CONCLUSION: Unenhanced phase images are not effective for HCC detection. Because of the significant increase in HCC detection, a delayed phase can be a useful adjunct to biphasic CT in patients at risk for developing HCC. {\textcopyright} RSNA, 2005.},

abstract = {This study assesses the magnetic resonance (MR) features of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) in patients with cirrhosis with specific analysis of the contrast enhancement pattern. Cholangiocarcinoma may show increased contrast uptake in the arterial phase, and, if washout in the delayed venous phase were to be detected, the noninvasive diagnostic criteria proposed in the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines would be refuted. We reviewed the MR findings of 25 patients with cirrhosis with 31 histologically confirmed ICC nodules. Signal intensity on basal T1-weighted and T2-weighted images and characteristics of enhancement after contrast administration on arterial, portal, and delayed phase were registered. Enhancement pattern was defined according to the behavior of the lesions in each phase, and dynamic pattern was described according to the progression of enhancement throughout the different phases. The most frequent pattern displayed by ICC was a progressive contrast uptake (80.6{\%}). Stable contrast enhancement was registered in 19.4{\%}. None of the ICCs showed a washout pattern, a profile that is specific for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The ICC dynamic behavior differed significantly according to tumor size: progressive enhancement pattern was the most frequent (20 of 25 cases) in lesions larger than 20 mm, whereas the stable pattern was mainly identified in nodules smaller than 20 mm. The most characteristic MR contrast pattern in ICC in cirrhosis is a progressive contrast uptake throughout the different phases, whereas contrast washout at delayed phases is not observed. Because stable enhancement pattern without washout also can be registered in small HCC nodules, the evaluation of delayed phase is mandatory for a proper nodule characterization. If washout is not registered, a biopsy should be mandatory for diagnosis. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2009 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical significance of the "transitional phase" at gadoxetate disodium (Gd-EOB)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: We studied 54 patients with 70 histologically diagnosed HCC. Transitional- and hepatobiliary-phase (TP, HBP) images were acquired 3 and 20 minutes after Gd-EOB injection, respectively. Radiologists measured the size of the hepatic tumors on images and surgical specimens and qualitatively evaluated the signal intensity of the hepatic tumors during TP and HBP independently. RESULTS: In 4 patients with portal tumor embolism who had undergone percutaneous transhepatic portal embolization and who manifested arterioportal (AP) shunts, the low-intensity area was larger during HBP than TP. Of the 70 HCCs, 4 were of high signal intensity during HBP and 2 were of slightly low intensity during TP. CONCLUSION: Tumor extension seen during TP rather than HBP more accurately reflected histological findings in patients with HCC with portal tumor thrombi, percutaneous transhepatic portal embolization, or AP shunt.

abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the predictive factors of malignant transformation of hypovascular hepatic nodule showing hypointensity in the hepatobiliary phase images of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI (HHN). Materials and Methods: The clinical data and imaging findings of dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (DCE-CT) and gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI for a total of 103 HHNs in 24 patients with chronic liver disease were retrospectively investigated. After the results of follow-up examinations were investigated, HHNs were categorized into the three groups for each comparison: (1) nodules with enlargement and/or vascularization and others, (2) nodules with only enlargement and others, (3) nodules with only vascularization and others. Enlargement and/or vascularization during the follow-up period were defined as malignant transformation of HHN. The frequency of each clinical datum and imaging finding in each group was compared to identify the predictive factors for malignant transformation in HHN. Results: Multivariate analysis showed that a nodule size of 9 mm or more on the initial gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI was a significant predictive factor for the enlargement and/or vascularization of HHN (P {\textless} 0.05). On the other hand, the hypoattenuation on the delayed phase imaging of the initial DCE-CT was a significant predictive factor for the enlargement or vascularization of HHN (P {\textless} 0.05). Conclusion: A nodule size of 9 mm or more on the initial gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI and hypoattenuation on the delayed phase imaging of initial DCE-CT would be helpful for predicting the outcome of HHN in patients with a risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE. We sought to determine whether hypointense hepatocellular nodules observed in the hepatobiliary phase of MRI enhanced with gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethyl-enetriamine pentaacetic acid (gadoxetate disodium) progress to hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI was repeated for 30 patients with 49 nodules determined to be hypointense in the hepatobiliary phase but nonenhancing in the arterial phase of dynamic MRI. The correlation between characteristics of hypointense nodules with slightly or markedly low signal intensity relative to surrounding liver parenchyma and their progression to hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma was analyzed in cirrhotic livers. All patients underwent angiography-assisted CT before MRI. The rate of progression to classic hepatocellular carcinoma was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS. The overall 6- and 12-month cumulative incidences of vascularization were 27.6{\%} and 43.5{\%}. The 6- and 12-month cumulative incidences of vascularized nodules with a maximum diameter 15 mm or greater were 43.3{\%} and 77.3{\%} and a maximum diameter less than 15 mm were 16.9{\%} and 16.9{\%}. The difference between these incidences was significant (p = 0.0147). CONCLUSION. Hypointense nodules with a maximum diameter of at least 15 mm often become hypervascular. Therefore, patients with hypointense nodules characterized by a maximum diameter of 15 mm or greater should be observed carefully because of the high incidence of vascularization. {\textcopyright} American Roentgen Ray Society.},

abstract = {Purpose: To elucidate the incidence of signal intensity patterns of borderline lesions of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on hepatobiliary phase Gd-EOB-DTPA (EOB) enhanced MRI and clarify the natural histories of these lesions. Materials and methods: Total 99 borderline lesions of HCC were identified by angiography-assisted CT. The signal intensity of borderline lesions on hepatobiliary phase of EOB-enhanced MRI was analyzed. Progress rate from borderline lesions to hypervascular HCC was calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method among each signal intensity groups of nodules. Results: On hepatobiliary phase of EOB-enhanced MRI, 41.4{\%} of the borderline lesions showed hypo-, 42.4{\%} showed iso-, and 16.2{\%} showed hyperintense, compared to background liver. Overall progress rates from borderline lesions to HCC were 10{\%} in 1-year, 14{\%} in 2-year and 20{\%} in 3-year follow-up period. Progress rates to HCC in hypointense borderline lesions were 17{\%} in 1-year, 28{\%} in 2-year and 41{\%} in 3-year follow-up period, and in isointense borderline lesions were 7{\%} in 1-year, 7{\%} in 2-year and 7{\%} in 3-year follow-up period. No hyperintense borderline lesions progressed to HCC in follow-up period. Conclusion: Although borderline lesions of HCC may show hypo-, iso- and hyperintensity on hepatobiliary phase of EOB-enhanced MRI, hypointense borderline lesions are high risk to progress HCC. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the imaging features of hypovascular hypointense nodules on hepatobiliary phase gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) images in patients with cirrhosis that may be associated with progression to hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Materials and Methods: The institutional review board approved this retrospective study and waived informed patient consent. This study included 135 patients with a diagnosis of hepatitis B-induced liver cirrhosis and 214 hypovascular hypointense nodules on hepatobiliary phase gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR images. MR images were analyzed with respect to nodule size, degree of hypointensity at hepatobiliary phase (four grades), presence of fat, and signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted (DW) images. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to identify variables that are associated with developing hypervascular HCC. Results: On follow-up MR images, 139 nodules (65.0{\%}) had no evidence of HCC (mean follow-up, 522 days) (group 1), but 75 (35.0{\%}) became hypervascular HCC (mean follow-up, 388 days) (group 2). Univariable Cox analysis revealed that the degree of hypointensity on hepatobiliary phase images (P = .044 and .001) and hyperintensity on T2-weighted and DW images (P = .001 and .0001) was significantly related to the development of hypervascular HCC. According to the multivariable Cox analysis, no other variable significantly adjusted the model once hyperintensity at initial DW imaging was already included as an associated variable, (hazard ratio, 7.44; 95{\%} confidence interval: 4.28, 12.94; P = .0001).

Materials and Institutional review board approval was obtained, and in-Methods: formed consent was waived. At multiple follow-up gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging examinations of 68 patients, 160 hypovascular nodules were retrospectively reviewed. A Cox regression model for hypervascularization was developed to explore the association of baseline characteristics, including patient factors (Child-Pugh classification, etiology of liver disease, history of local therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC], and coexistence of hypervascular HCC) and MR imaging fndings (fat content, signal intensity on T2-weighted images, and nodule size). In addition, the growth rate was calculated as the reciprocal of tumor volume doubling time to investigate its relationship with subsequent hypervascularization by using receiver operating characteristic and Kaplan-Meier analyses. Results: The prevalence of subsequent hypervascularization was 31{\%} (50 of 160 nodules). Independent Cox multivariable predictors of increased risk of hypervascularization were hyperintensity on T2-weighted images (hazard ratio [HR] = 8.7;95{\%} confidence interval [CI]:3.6, 20.8), previous local therapy for hypervascular HCC (HR = 5.0;95{\%} CI:1.8, 13.6), Child-Pugh B cirrhosis (HR = 3.6;95{\%} CI:1.4, 9.5) and coexistence of hypervascular HCC (HR = 2.0;95{\%} CI:1.0, 3.8). The mean growth rate was significantly higher in nodules that showed subsequent hypervascularization than in those without hypervascularization. Kaplan-Meier analysis based on the receiver operating characteristic cutoff level (1.8 ×10-3/day [tumor volume doubling time, 542 days]) showed that nodules with a higher growth rate had a significantly higher incidence of hypervascularization (P = 5.2 ×10-8, log-rank test). Conclusion: Hyperintensity on T2-weighted images is an independent and strong risk factor at baseline for subsequent hypervascularization in hypovascular nodules in patients with chronic liver disease. Tumor volume doubling time of less than 542 days was associated with a high rate of subsequent hypervascularization. {\textcopyright} RSNA, 2013.},

Materials and Methods: The institutional review board approved this retrospective study and waived the requirement for informed consent. The study included 130 patients (95 men, 35 women) with 179 surgically confirmed small HCCs (≤2.0 cm) and 130 patients with cirrhosis (90 men, 40 women) without HCC who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging and DW imaging at 3.0 T between May 2009 and July 2010. Three sets of images were analyzed independently by three observers to detect HCC: a gadoxetic acid set (unenhanced, early dynamic, and hepatobiliary phases), a DW imaging set, and a combined set. Data were analyzed by using alternative-free response receiver operating characteristic analysis. Diagnostic accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [Az]), sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value were calculated. Results: The mean Az values for the combined set (0.952) were significantly higher than those for the gadoxetic acid set (Az = 0.902) or the DW imaging set alone (Az = 0.871) (P ≤ .008). On a per-lesion basis, observers showed higher sensitivity in their analyses of the combined set (range, 91.1{\%}-93.3{\%} [163-167 of 179]) than in those of the gadoxetic acid set (range, 80.5{\%}-82.1{\%} [144-147 of 179]) or the DW imaging set alone (range, 77.7{\%}-79.9{\%} [139-143 of 179]) (P ≤ .003). Positive predictive values and specificity for all observers were equivalent for the three imaging sets.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE. We compared the diagnostic performance of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI with that of triple-phase 16-, 40-, and 64-MDCT in the preoperative detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Sixty-two consecutively registered patients (54 men, eight women; age range, 31-67 years) with 83 HCCs underwent triple-phase (arterial, portal venous, equilibrium) CT at 16-, 40-, or 64-MDCT and gadoxetic acid-enhanced 3-T MRI. The diagnosis of HCC was established after surgical resection. Three observers independently and randomly reviewed the MR and CT images on a tumor-by-tumor basis. The diagnostic accuracy of these techniques in the detection of HCC was assessed with alternative free response receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Sensitivity, positive and negative predictive values, and sensitivity according to tumor size were evaluated. RESULTS. For each observer, the areas under the ROC curve were 0.971, 0.959, and 0.967 for MRI and 0.947, 0.950, and 0.943 for CT. The differences were not statistically significant between the two techniques for each observer (p {\textgreater} 0.05). The differences in sensitivity and positive and negative predictive values between the two techniques for each observer were not statistically significant (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Among 10 HCCs 1 cm in diameter or smaller, each of the observers detected seven tumors with MRI. With CT, one observer detected five, one observer detected four, and one observer detected three HCCs with no statistically significant difference (p {\textgreater} 0.05). CONCLUSION. Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI and triple-phase MDCT have similar diagnostic performance in the preoperative detection of HCC, but MRI may be better than MDCT in the detection of HCC 1 cm in diameter or smaller. {\textcopyright} American Roentgen Ray Society.},

@article{Llovet2008,
abstract = {The design of clinical trials in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is complex because many patients have concurrent liver disease, which can confound the assessment of clinical benefit. There is an urgent need for high-quality trials in this disease. An expert panel was convened by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases to develop guidelines that provide a common framework for designing trials to facilitate comparability of results. According to these guidelines, randomized phase 2 trials with a time-to-event primary endpoint, such as time to progression, are pivotal in clinical research on HCC. Survival remains the main endpoint to measure effectiveness in phase 3 studies, whereas time to recurrence is proposed as an appropriate endpoint in the adjuvant setting. Because progression-free survival and disease-free survival are composite endpoints, they are more vulnerable than others in HCC clinical studies and may not be able to capture clinical benefits. Selection of the target population should be based on the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system. New drugs should be tested in patients with well-preserved liver function (Child-Pugh A class). Patients assigned to the control arm should receive standard-of-care therapy, that is, chemoembolization for patients with intermediate-stage disease and sorafenib for patients with advanced-stage disease. Further research is needed to incorporate biomarkers and molecular imaging into clinical research in HCC. These surrogate markers may help to enrich study populations and maximize the cost-benefit ratio of trial execution. Design and conduct of phase 3 trials should be coordinated by centers with appropriate expertise in HCC. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Background. The role of orthotopic liver trans- plantation in the treatment of patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma is controversial, and determin- ing which patients are likely to have a good outcome after liver transplantation is difficult. Methods. We studied 48 patients with cirrhosis who had small, unresectable hepatocellular carcinomas and who underwent liver transplantation. In 94 percent of the patients, the cirrhosis was related to infection with hepati- tis B virus, hepatitis C virus, or both. The presence of tumor was confirmed by biopsy or serum alpha-fetoprotein as- say. The criteria for eligibility for transplantation were the presence of a tumor 5 cm or less in diameter in patients with single hepatocellular carcinomas and no more than three tumor nodules, each 3 cm or less in diameter, in pa- tients with multiple tumors. Twenty-eight patients with suf- ficient hepatic function underwent treatment for the tumor, mainly chemoembolization, before transplantation. After liver transplantation, the patients were followed prospec- tively for a median of 26 months (range, 9 to 54). No anti- cancer treatment was given after transplantation. Results. The overall mortality rate was 17 percent. Af-ter four years, the actuarial survival rate was 75 percent and the rate of recurrence-free survival was 83 percent. Hepatocellular carcinoma recurred in four patients (8 per- cent). The overall and recurrence-free survival rates at four years among the 35 patients (73 percent of the total) who met the predetermined criteria for the selection of small hepatocellular carcinomas at pathological review of the explanted liver were 85 percent and 92 percent, re- spectively, whereas the rates in the 13 patients (27 per- cent) whose tumors exceeded these limits were 50 per- cent and 59 percent, respectively (P ? 0.01 for overall survival; P ? 0.002 for recurrence-free survival). In this group of 48 patients with early-stage tumors, tumor–node– metastasis status, the number of tumors, the serum alpha- fetoprotein concentration, treatment received before trans- plantation, and 10 other variables were not significantly correlated with survival. Conclusions. Liver transplantation is an effective treat- ment for small, unresectable hepatocellular carcino- mas in patients with cirrhosis. (N Engl J Med 1996;334: 693-9.)},

abstract = {PURPOSE The BCLC staging classification has been widely endorsed to predict the prognosis of patients with HCC. However, its validity as a means of therapeutic instructions needs to be challenged. This study aimed to evaluate perioperative and long-term outcomes of surgical resection in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging. METHODS This study used a prospectively maintained database consisting of a consecutive series of 511 Chinese patients with advanced HCC who underwent surgical resection in a hepatobiliary surgical center from 2001 to 2007. Mortality, morbidity, long-term overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were evaluated. RESULTS Hospital mortality was 2.3{\%}, and overall morbidity was 31.3{\%}. After a median follow-up period of 27.8 months (range, 0-112 months), the 1-, 3- and 5-year OS rate was 69.9, 41.2 and 30.5{\%}, and the 1-, 3- and 5-year DFS rate was 48.2, 30.3 and 24.0{\%}, respectively. The 1-, 3- and 5-year OS and DFS rates were significantly poorer in patients with vascular invasion and/or extrahepatic spread than those in patients without (both P {\textless} 0.001), and also poorer in patients with biliary invasion than those in patients without (both P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Surgical resection could be considered in part of patients with advanced HCC (BCLC stage C), with low mortality, acceptable morbidity and favorable survival benefits. These results imply that BCLC recommendations for treatment schedules of advanced HCC need to be re-evaluated.},

abstract = {Liver transplantation is proposed as the best therapy for early hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic patients. However, the confrontation with the results obtained by surgical resection has never been done on an intention-to-treat basis. Between 1989 and 1997, 164 out of 1,265 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were evaluated for surgery. Seventy-seven (48 men, mean 61 years of age, 74 Child-Pugh class A, size 33 ± 18 mm) were resected (first line option) and 87 (65 men, mean 55 years of age, 50 Child- Pugh class B/C, size 24 ± 14 mm) were selected for transplantation. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year 'intention-to-treat' survival was 85{\%}, 62{\%}, and 51{\%} for resection and 84{\%}, 69{\%}, and 69{\%} for transplantation (8 drop-outs on waiting list). Bilirubin and clinically relevant portal hypertension were independent survival predictors after resection. Thereby, the 5-year survival of the best candidates (absence of clinically relevant portal hypertension, n = 35) was 74{\%}, whereas it was 25{\%} for the worst candidates (portal hypertension and bilirubin ≥ 1 mg/dL, n = 27) (P {\textless} .00001). The variable 'drop-out on waiting list' was the sole survival predictor after transplantation. The 2-year survival rate of patients evaluated for transplantation was 84{\%} in the 1989 to 1995 period (mean waiting time, 62 days; no drop-outs) and 54{\%} during 1996 to 1997 (mean waiting time, 162 days; 8 drop-outs) (P {\textless} .003). This outcome was significantly lower than that of the best candidates for resection (P = .002). In conclusion, a proper selection of candidates for resection promotes better results than transplantation, in which the results are significantly hampered by the growing incidence of drop-outs because of the increasing waiting time.},

@article{Forner2012,
abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma is the sixth most prevalent cancer and the third most frequent cause of cancer-related death. Patients with cirrhosis are at highest risk of developing this malignant disease, and ultrasonography every 6 months is recommended. Surveillance with ultrasonography allows diagnosis at early stages when the tumour might be curable by resection, liver transplantation, or ablation, and 5-year survival higher than 50 can be achieved. Patients with small solitary tumours and very well preserved liver function are the best candidates for surgical resection. Liver transplantation is most beneficial for individuals who are not good candidates for resection, especially those within Milano criteria (solitary tumour ≤5 cm and up to three nodules ≤3 cm). Donor shortage greatly limits its applicability. Percutaneous ablation is the most frequently used treatment but its effectiveness is limited by tumour size and localisation. In asymptomatic patients with multifocal disease without vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread not amenable to curative treatments, chemoembolisation can provide survival benefit. Findings of randomised trials of sorafenib have shown survival benefits for individuals with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting that molecular-targeted therapies could be effective in this chemoresistant cancer. Research is active in the area of pathogenesis and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

IGA is recommended by most guidelines as the best therapeutic choice for patients with early stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-defined as either a single tumour smaller than 5 cm or up to three nodules smaller than 3 cm-when surgical options are precluded, and has potential as first-line therapy, in lieu of surgery, for patients with very early stage tumours smaller than 2 cm. With regard to renal cell carcinoma, despite the absence of any randomized trial comparing the outcomes of IGA with those of standard partial nephrectomy, a growing amount of data demonstrate robust oncological outcomes for this minimally invasive approach and testify to its potential as a standard-of-care treatment. Herein, we review the various ablation techniques, the supporting evidence, and clinical application of IGA in the treatment of primary liver and kidney cancers.},

@article{Bale2019,
abstract = {This retrospective study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of three-dimensional (3D)-navigated multiprobe radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with intraprocedural image fusion for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by histopathological examination. From 2009 to 2018, 97 patients (84 men, 13 women; median age, 60 years; range, 1-71) were transplanted after bridging therapy of 195 HCCs by stereotactic RFA (SRFA). The median interval between the first SRFA and transplantation was 6.8 months (range, 0-71). The rate of residual vital tissue (RVT) could be assessed in 188 of 195 lesions in 96 of 97 patients by histological examination of the explanted livers using hematoxylin and eosin (H{\&}E) and Tdt-mediated UTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) stains. Histopathological results were compared with the findings of the last computed tomography (CT) imaging before liver transplantation (LT). Median number and size of treated tumors were 1 (range, 1-8) and 2.5 cm (range, 1-8). Complete radiological response was achieved in 186 of 188 nodules (98.9{\%}) and 94 of 96 patients (97.9{\%}) and complete pathological response in the explanted liver specimen in 183 of 188 nodules (97.3{\%}) and 91 of 96 patients (94.8{\%}), respectively. In lesions ≥3 cm, complete tumor cell death was achieved in 50 of 52 nodules (96.2{\%}). Residual tumor did not correlate with tumor size (P = 0.5). Conclusion: Multiprobe SRFA with intraprocedural image fusion represents an efficient, minimally invasive therapy for HCC, even with tumor sizes larger than 3 cm, and without the need of a combination with additional treatments. The results seem to justify the additional efforts related to the stereotactic approach.},

abstract = {Objectives: To assess the minimal ablative margin (MAM) by image fusion of intraprocedural pre- and post-ablation contrast-enhanced CT images and to evaluate if it can predict local tumor progression (LTP) independently. Furthermore, to determine a MAM with which a stereotactic radiofrequency ablation (SRFA) can be determined successful and therefore used as an intraprocedural tool to evaluate treatment success. Methods: A total of 110 patients (20 women, 90 men; mean age 63.7 ± 10.2) with 176 hepatocellular carcinomas were assessed by retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. The MAM was determined through image fusion of intraprocedural pre- and post-ablation images using commercially available rigid imaging registration software. LTP was assessed in contrast-enhanced CTs or MR scans at 3–6-month intervals. Results: The MAM was the only significant independent predictor of LTP (p = 0.036). For each millimeter increase of the MAM, a 30{\%} reduction of the relative risk for LTP was found (OR = 0.7, 95{\%} CI 0.5–0.98, p = 0.036). No LTP was detected in lesions with a MAM {\textgreater} 5 mm. The overall LTP rate was 9 of 110 (8.2{\%}) on a patient level and 10 of 173 (5.7{\%}) on a lesion level. The median MAM was 3.4 (1.7–6.9) mm. The mean overall follow-up period was 26.0 ± 10.3 months. Conclusions: An immediate assessment of the minimal ablative margin (MAM) can be used as an intraprocedural tool to evaluate the treatment success in patients treated with stereotactic RFA. A MAM {\textgreater} 5 mm has to be achieved to consider an ablation as successful. Key Points: • An intraoperatively measured minimal ablative margin (MAM) {\textgreater} 5 mm correlates with complete remission. • MAM is the only significant independent predictor of LTP (OR = 0.7, 95{\%} CI 0.5–0.98, p = 0.036) after stereotactic RFA of hepatocellular carcinoma. • Image fusion using commercially available rigid imaging registration software is possible, even though considerably complex. Therefore, improved (semi-)automatic fusion software is highly desirable.},

abstract = {Thermal ablation has proven beneficial for hepatocellular carcinoma and possibly for colorectal liver metastases, but data is lacking for other liver metastases. Computer-assisted navigation can increase ablation efficacy and broaden its indications. We present our experience with percutaneous stereotactic image-guided microwave ablation (SMWA) for non-colorectal liver metastases (NCRLM), in form of a retrospective study including all SMWA for NCRLM from 2015 to 2017. Indication for SMWA was determined at a multidisciplinary tumorboard. End-points include recurrence, overall and liver-specific disease progression and complications. Twenty-three patients underwent 25 interventions for 40 lesions, including 17 neuroendocrine tumor, nine breast cancer, four sarcoma, two non-small cell lung cancer, three duodenal adenocarcinoma, one esophageal adenocarcinoma, one pancreatic adenocarcinoma, one ampullary carcinoma, one prostate carcinoma, and one renal cell carcinoma metastases. Median follow-up was 15 months (2–32). Incomplete ablation rate was 2.5{\%} (1/40), local recurrence rate 10{\%} (4/40). Three patients (12{\%}) had minor complications. Overall disease progression was 73.9{\%} (17/23), median disease-free survival 7 months (0–26) and overall survival 18 months (2–39). SIMWA is feasible, safe and minimally invasive for NCRLM in selected patients.

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: Transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) improves survival of properly selected patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Drug eluting beads (DEB) provide a calibrated and homogenous procedure while increasing efficacy. Outcome data applying this technology is lacking, and this is instrumental for clinical decision-making and for trial design. We evaluated the survival of HCC patients treated with DEB-TACE following a strict selection (preserved liver function, absence of symptoms, extrahepatic spread or vascular invasion). Methods: We registered baseline characteristics, the development of treatment-related adverse events, and the overall survival of all HCC patients treated by DEB-TACE from February 2004 to June 2010. Results: One hundred and four patients were treated with DEB-TACE. All but one were cirrhotic, 62.5{\%} HCV+, 95{\%} Child-Pugh A, 41 BCLC-A and 63 BCLC-B. Causes of DEB-TACE treatment in BCLC-A patients were: 35 unfeasible ablation, and six post-treatment recurrences. After a median follow-up of 24.5 months, 38 patients had died, two patients had received transplantation and 24 had received sorafenib because of untreatable tumour progression. Median survival of the cohort was 48.6 months (95{\%} CI: 36.9-61.2), while it was 54.2 months in BCLC stage A and 47.7 months in stage B. Median survival after censoring follow-up at time of transplant/sorafenib was 47.7 (95{\%} CI: 37.9-57.5) months. Conclusions: These data validate the safety of DEB-TACE and show that the survival expectancy applying current selection criteria and technique is better than that previously reported. A 50{\%} survival at 4 years should be considered when suggesting treatment for patients fitting into controversial scenarios such as expanded criteria for transplantation/resection for multifocal HCC. {\textcopyright} 2012 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

abstract = {Aim: The present study aimed to investigate the status of primary liver tumors diagnosed in the Emergency Hospital of Mures County, Romania. Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective study based on data collected from histopathological bulletins stored in the archives of the Pathology Laboratories of Mures County. We selected those patients' data that were diagnosed with liver tumors during January 2004-August 2011. The acquired data were collected and processed statistically using the GraphPad InStat Demo 3 statistical software. Results: We identified 748 liver tumors out of which 264 were primary liver tumors (35.29{\%}), whereof 108 were malignant primary liver tumors and 156 benign liver tumors. The male:female ratio in case of malignant tumors was 1.7:1 and for benign tumors it was 1:2.62. In case of malignant tumors, the mean age of male patients was 63.98±11.67 as for female patients it was 60.14±11.65 years. In case of benign tumors, the mean age of male patients was 59.29±9.58 as for female patients it was 55.55±12.86. 81.48{\%} of the malignant tumors were hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), followed by cholangiocarcinoma (14.81{\%}). 40{\%} of HCC presented associated cirrhosis, in the other 60{\%} signs of chronic alcoholism being observed. Conclusions: Hepatocellular carcinoma remains the first on the list of malignant primary liver tumors in Romanian patients, probably due to a high rate of alcohol consumption.},

abstract = {Purpose: To identify the reproducible and nonredundant radiomics features (RFs) for computed tomography (CT). Materials and Methods: Two phantoms were used to test RF reproducibility by using test-retest analysis, by changing the CT acquisition parameters (hereafter, intra-CT analysis), and by comparing five different scanners with the same CT parameters (hereafter, inter-CT analysis). Reproducible RFs were selected by using the concordance correlation coefficient (as a measure of the agreement between variables) and the coefficient of variation (defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean). Redundant features were grouped by using hierarchical cluster analysis. Results: A total of 177 RFs including intensity, shape, and texture features were evaluated. The test-retest analysis showed that 91{\%} (161 of 177) of the RFs were reproducible according to concordance correlation coefficient. Reproducibility of intra-CT RFs, based on coefficient of variation, ranged from 89.3{\%} (151 of 177) to 43.1{\%} (76 of 177) where the pitch factor and the reconstruction kernel were modified, respectively. Reproducibility of inter-CT RFs, based on coefficient of variation, also showed large material differences, from 85.3{\%} (151 of 177; wood) to only 15.8{\%} (28 of 177; polyurethane). Ten clusters were identified after the hierarchical cluster analysis and one RF per cluster was chosen as representative. Conclusion: Many RFs were redundant and nonreproducible. If all the CT parameters are fixed except field of view, tube voltage, and milliamperage, then the information provided by the analyzed RFs can be summarized in only 10 RFs (each representing a cluster) because of redundancy.},

	abstract = {Radiomics is an emerging field which extracts quantitative radiology data from medical images and explores their correlation with clinical outcomes in a non-invasive manner. This review aims to assess whether radiomics is a useful and reproducible method for clinical management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by reviewing the strengths and weaknesses of current radiomics literature pertaining specifically to HCC. From an initial set of 48 articles recovered through database searches, 23 articles were retained to be included in this review after full screening. Among these 23 studies, 7 used a radiomics approach in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Only two studies applied radiomics to positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET–CT). In the remaining 14 articles, a radiomics analysis was performed on computed tomography (CT). Eight studies dealt with the relationship between biological signatures and imaging findings, and can be classified as radiogenomic studies. For each study included in our review, we computed a Radiomics Quality Score (RQS) as proposed by Lambin et al. We found that the RQS (mean ± standard deviation) was 8.35 ± 5.38 (out of a possible maximum value of 36). Although these scores are fairly low, and radiomics has not yet reached clinical utility in HCC, it is important to underscore the fact that these early studies pave the way for the radiomics field with a focus on HCC. Radiomics is still a very young field, and is far from being mature, but it remains a very promising technology for the future for developing adequate personalized treatment as a non-invasive approach, for complementing or replacing tumor biopsies, as well as for developing novel prognostic biomarkers in HCC patients.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To determine whether conventional contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) could be used to identify imaging phenotypes associated with a doxorubicin drug response gene expression program in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using an integrated imaging-genomic approach. Materials and Methods: Thirty HCCs were analyzed and scored individually across six predefined imaging phenotypes. Unsupervised and supervised bioinformatics analyses were performed to correlate the imaging scores with the corresponding tumor microarray data (each microarray contained gene expression measurements across ∼18,000 genes) to identify relationships between the imaging traits and underlying tumor gene expression. Enrichment for a predefined doxorubicin-response gene expression program was then performed against the imaging phenotype-associated genes and enrichment determined. Results: An imaging phenotype related to tumor margins on arterial phase images demonstrated significant correlation with the doxorubicin-response transcriptional program (P {\textless} .05, q {\textless} 0.1). It was also significantly associated with HCC venous invasion and tumor stage (P {\textless} .05, q {\textless} 0.1). Tumors with higher tumor margin scores were more strongly associated with the doxorubicin resistance transcriptional program and had a greater prevalence of venous invasion and worse stage. Tumors with lower tumor margin scores, however, demonstrated a converse relationship. Conclusions: It is possible to identify HCC imaging phenotypes at CT that correlate with a doxorubicin drug response gene expression program. Given the role of doxorubicin in regional therapies for HCC management, it is possible that such an approach could be used to guide HCC therapy on a tumor-by-tumor basis on the basis of underlying tumor gene expression patterns. {\textcopyright} 2007 SIR.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE We aimed to develop and validate a radiomics nomogram for preoperative prediction of microvascular invasion (MVI) in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS A total of 304 eligible patients with HCC were randomly divided into training (n=184) and independent validation (n=120) cohorts. Portal venous and arterial phase computed tomography data of the HCCs were collected to extract radiomic features. Using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm, the training set was processed to reduce data dimensions, feature selection, and construction of a radiomics signature. Then, a prediction model including the radiomics signature, radiologic features, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level, as presented in a radiomics nomogram, was developed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. The radiomics nomogram was analyzed based on its discrimination ability, calibration, and clinical usefulness. Internal cohort data were validated using the radiomics nomogram. RESULTS The radiomics signature was significantly associated with MVI status (P {\textless} 0.001, both cohorts). Predictors, including the radiomics signature, nonsmooth tumor margin, hypoattenuating halos, internal arteries, and alpha-fetoprotein level were reserved in the individualized prediction nomogram. The model exhibited good calibration and discrimination in the training and validation cohorts (C-index [95{\%} confidence interval]: 0.846 [0.787-0.905] and 0.844 [0.774-0.915], respectively). Its clinical usefulness was confirmed using a decision curve analysis. CONCLUSION The radiomics nomogram, as a noninvasive preoperative prediction method, shows a favorable predictive accuracy for MVI status in patients with HBV-related HCC.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE Computed tomography texture analysis (CTTA) is a method of quantifying lesion heterogeneity based on distribution of pixel intensities within a region of interest. This study investigates the ability of CTTA to distinguish different hypervascular liver lesions and compares CTTA parameters by creating a proof-of-concept model to distinguish between different lesions. METHODS Following institutional review board approval, CTTA software (TexRAD Ltd) was used to retrospectively analyze 17 cases of focal nodular hyperplasia, 19 hepatic adenomas, 25 hepatocellular carcinomas, and 19 cases of normal liver parenchyma using arterial phase scans. Two radiologists read the same image series used by the CTTA software and reported their best guess diagnosis. Computed tomography texture analysis parameters were computed from regions of interest using spatial band-pass filters to quantify heterogeneity. Random-forest method was used to construct a predictive model from these parameters, and a separate regression model was created using a subset of parameters. RESULTS The random-forest model successfully distinguished the 3 lesion types and normal liver with predicted classification performance accuracy for 91.2{\%} for adenoma, 94.4{\%} for focal nodular hyperplasia, and 98.6{\%} for hepatocellular carcinoma. This error prediction was generated using a subset of data points not used in generation of the model, but not on discrete prospective cases. In contrast, the 2 human readers using the same image series data analyzed by the CTTA software had lower accuracies, of 72.2{\%} and 65.6{\%}, respectively. The explicit regression model with a subset of image parameters had intermediate overall accuracy of 84.9{\%}. CONCLUSIONS Computed tomography texture analysis may prove valuable in lesion characterization. Differentiation between common hypervascular lesion types could be aided by the judicious incorporation of texture parameters into clinical analysis.},

Wavelet decomposition was performed on portal-phase CT images with three bandwidth responses (filter 0, 1.0, and 1.5). Nine textural features of each filter were extracted from regions of interest. Wavelet-2-H (filter 1.0) in LR and wavelet-2-V (filter 0 and 1.0) in TACE were related to survival. Subsequently, LR and TACE patients were divided based on the wavelet-2-H and wavelet-2-V median at filter 1.0 into two subgroups (+ or -). LR+ patients showed the best survival, followed by LR-, TACE+, and TACE-. We estimated that LR+ patients treated using TACE would exhibit a survival similar to TACE-patients and worse than TACE+ patients, with a severe compromise in overall survival. LR was recommended for TACE-patients, whereas TACE was preferred for LR-and TACE+ patients. Independent of tumor size, CT textural features showed positive and negative correlations with survival after LR and TACE, respectively. Although further validation is needed, texture analysis demonstrated the feasibility of using HCC patient stratification for determining the suitability of LR vs. TACE.},

	abstract = {To reduce the risks of climate change, governments agreed in the Paris Agreement to limit global 17 temperature rise to less than 2.0°C above pre-industrial levels, with the ambition to keep warming to 18 19 1.5°C. Charting appropriate mitigation responses requires information on the costs of mitigating versus 20 associated damages for the two levels of warming. In this assessment, a critical consideration is the 21 impact on crop yields and yield variability in regions currently challenged by food insecurity. The current 22 23 study assessed impacts of 1.5°C versus 2.0°C on yields of maize, pearl millet and sorghum in the West 24 African Sudan Savanna using two crop models that were calibrated with common varieties from 25 experiments in the region while management reflected a range of typical sowing windows. As 26 sustainable intensification is promoted in the region for improving food security, simulations were 27 28 conducted for both current fertilizer use and for an intensification case (fertility not limiting). With 29 current fertilizer use, results indicated 2{\%} units higher losses for maize and sorghum with 2.0°C 30 compared to 1.5°C warming, with no change in millet yields for either scenario. In the intensification 31 32 case, yield losses due to climate change were larger than with current fertilizer levels. However, despite 33 the larger losses, yields were always 2-3 times higher with intensification, irrespective of the warming 34 scenario. Though yield variability increased with intensification, there was no interaction with warming 35 scenario. Risk and market analysis are needed to extend these results to understand implications for 36 37 food security.},

	abstract = {Rationale and objectives: To investigate the impact of random survival forest (RSF) classifier trained by radiomics features over the prediction of the overall survival of patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Materials and methods: The dynamic computed tomography data of 127 patients (97 men, 30 women; mean age, 68 years) newly diagnosed with resectable HCC were retrospectively analyzed. After manually setting the region of interest to include the tumor within the slice at its maximum diameter, texture analyses were performed with or without a Laplacian of Gaussian filter. Using the extracted 96 histogram based texture features, RSFs were trained using 5-fold cross-validation to predict the individual risk for each patient on disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). The associations between individual risk and DFS or OS were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. The effects of the predicted individual risk and clinical variables upon OS were analyzed using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. Results: Among the 96 histogram based texture features, RSF extracted 8 of high importance for DFS and 15 for OS. The RSF trained by these features distinguished two patient groups with high and low predicted individual risk (P = 1.1 × 10−4 for DFS, 4.8 × 10−7 for OS). Based on the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, high predicted individual risk (hazard ratio = 1.06 per 1{\%} increase, P = 8.4 × 10−8) and vascular invasion (hazard ratio = 1.74, P = 0.039) were the only unfavorable prognostic factors. Conclusions: The combination of radiomics analysis and RSF might be useful in predicting the prognosis of patients with resectable HCC.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES In this preliminary study, we examined whether imaging-based phenotypes are associated with reported predictive gene signatures in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS Thirty-eight patients (M/F 30/8, mean age 61 years) who underwent pre-operative CT or MR imaging before surgery as well as transcriptome profiling were included in this IRB-approved single-centre retrospective study. Eleven qualitative and four quantitative imaging traits (size, enhancement ratios, wash-out ratio, tumour-to-liver contrast ratios) were assessed by three observers and were correlated with 13 previously reported HCC gene signatures using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS Thirty-nine HCC tumours (mean size 5.7 ± 3.2 cm) were assessed. Significant positive associations were observed between certain imaging traits and gene signatures of aggressive HCC phenotype (G3-Boyault, Proliferation-Chiang profiles, CK19-Villanueva, S1/S2-Hoshida) with odds ratios ranging from 4.44-12.73 (P {\textless}0.045). Infiltrative pattern at imaging was significantly associated with signatures of microvascular invasion and aggressive phenotype. Significant but weak associations were also observed between each enhancement ratio and tumour-to-liver contrast ratios and certain gene expression profiles. CONCLUSIONS This preliminary study demonstrates a correlation between phenotypic imaging traits with gene signatures of aggressive HCC, which warrants further prospective validation to establish imaging-based surrogate markers of molecular phenotypes in HCC.

Materials and methods A total of 61 HCC patients were enrolled in this retrospective study. Textural characteristics of the computed tomography (CT) images were quantified. The differences between the hepatic arterial phase and the portal venous phase were obtained (the Dif.). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used for data screening. Cox regression analyses were performed to determine independent factors adjusted with the derived clinical and radiological variables. Model identifications were based on Akaike information criteria. Kaplan–Meier and log-rank tests were performed for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Results ROC and Cox regression analyses identified five parameters. Filter 1.0 achieved the best performance, in which the Dif.Scale 1.2 was a superior indicative independent marker for OS (p = 0.05).

METHODS A total of 215 HCC patients who underwent partial hepatectomy were enrolled in this retrospective study, and all the patients were followed up at least within 1 year. Radiomics features were extracted from arterial- and portal venous-phase CT images, and a radiomics signature was built by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression model. Preoperative clinical factors associated with early recurrence were evaluated. A radiomics signature, a clinical model, and a combined model were built, and the area under the curve (AUC) of operating characteristics (ROC) was used to explore their performance to discriminate early recurrence. RESULTS Twenty-one radiomics features were chosen from 300 candidate features to build a radiomics signature that was significantly associated with early recurrence (P {\textless} 0.001), and they presented good performance in the discrimination of early recurrence alone with an AUC of 0.817 (95{\%} CI: 0.758-0.866), sensitivity of 0.794, and specificity of 0.699. The AUCs of the clinical and combined models were 0.781 (95{\%} CI: 0.719-0.834) and 0.836 (95{\%} CI: 0.779-0.883), respectively, with the sensitivity being 0.784 and 0.824, and the specificity being 0.619 and 0.708, respectively. Adding a radiomics signature into conventional clinical variables can significantly improve the accuracy of the preoperative model in predicting early recurrence (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS The radiomics signature was a significant predictor for early recurrence in HCC. Incorporating radiomics signature into conventional clinical factors performed better for preoperative estimation of early recurrence than with clinical variables alone.},

abstract = {Objectives: To investigate whether liver fibrosis can be staged by deep learning techniques based on CT images. Methods: This clinical retrospective study, approved by our institutional review board, included 496 CT examinations of 286 patients who underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced CT for evaluations of the liver and for whom histopathological information regarding liver fibrosis stage was available. The 396 portal phase images with age and sex data of patients (F0/F1/F2/F3/F4 = 113/36/56/66/125) were used for training a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN); the data for the other 100 (F0/F1/F2/F3/F4 = 29/9/14/16/32) were utilised for testing the trained network, with the histopathological fibrosis stage used as reference. To improve robustness, additional images for training data were generated by rotating or parallel shifting the images, or adding Gaussian noise. Supervised training was used to minimise the difference between the liver fibrosis stage and the fibrosis score obtained from deep learning based on CT images (F DLCT score) output by the model. Testing data were input into the trained DCNNs to evaluate their performance. Results: The F DLCT scores showed a significant correlation with liver fibrosis stage (Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.48, p {\textless} 0.001). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (with 95{\%} confidence intervals) for diagnosing significant fibrosis (≥ F2), advanced fibrosis (≥ F3) and cirrhosis (F4) by using F DLCT scores were 0.74 (0.64–0.85), 0.76 (0.66–0.85) and 0.73 (0.62–0.84), respectively. Conclusions: Liver fibrosis can be staged by using a deep learning model based on CT images, with moderate performance. Key Points: • Liver fibrosis can be staged by a deep learning model based on magnified CT images including the liver surface, with moderate performance. • Scores from a trained deep learning model showed moderate correlation with histopathological liver fibrosis staging. • Further improvement are necessary before utilisation in clinical settings.},

Masses were diagnosed according to five categories (category A, classic hepato-cellular carcinomas [HCCs]; category B, malignant liver tumors other than classic and early HCCs; category C, indeterminate masses or mass-like lesions [including early HCCs and dysplastic nodules] and rare benign liver masses other than hemangiomas and cysts; category D, hemangiomas; and category E, cysts). Supervised training was performed by using 55 536 image sets obtained in 2013 (from 460 patients, 1068 sets were obtained and they were augmented by a factor of 52 [rotated, parallel-shifted, strongly enlarged, and noise-added images were generated from the original images]). The CNN was com-posed of six convolutional, three maximum pooling, and three fully connected layers. The CNN was tested with 100 liver mass image sets obtained in 2016 (74 men and 26 women; mean age, 66.4 years 6 10.6 [standard devi-ation]; mean mass size, 26.9 mm 6 25.9; 21, nine, 35, 20, and 15 liver masses for categories A, B, C, D, and E, respectively). Training and testing were performed five times. Accuracy for categorizing liver masses with CNN model and the area under receiver operating character-istic curve for differentiating categories A–B versus cate-gories C–E were calculated.},

abstract = {Liver cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Computer-aided diagnoses play an important role in liver lesion diagnoses (classification). Recently, several deep-learning-based computer-aided diagnosis systems have been proposed for the classification of liver lesions. The effectiveness of these systems has been demonstrated; however, the main challenge in deep-learning-based medical image classification is the lack of annotated training samples. In this paper, we demonstrate that transfer learning and fine-tuning can significantly improve the accuracy of liver lesion classification, especially for small training samples. We used the residual convolutional neural network (ResNet), which is a state-of-the-art network, as our baseline network for focal liver lesion classification using multiphase CT images. Fine-tuning significantly improved the classification accuracy from 83.7{\%} to 91.2{\%}. This classification accuracy (91.2{\%}) is higher than that of state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate the effect of image registration on the diagnostic performance of transfer learning (TL) using pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and three-phasic dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (DCE-CT) for primary liver cancers. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 215 consecutive patients with histologically proven primary liver cancers, including six early, 58 well-differentiated, 109 moderately differentiated, 29 poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), and 13 non-HCC malignant lesions containing cholangiocellular components. We performed TL using various pretrained CNNs and preoperative three-phasic DCE-CT images. Three-phasic DCE-CT images were manually registered to correct respiratory motion. The registered DCE-CT images were then assigned to the three color channels of an input image for TL: pre-contrast, early phase, and delayed phase images for the blue, red, and green channels, respectively. To evaluate the effects of image registration, the registered input image was intentionally misaligned in the three color channels by pixel shifts, rotations, and skews with various degrees. The diagnostic performances (DP) of the pretrained CNNs after TL in the test set were compared by three general radiologists (GRs) and two experienced abdominal radiologists (ARs). The effects of misalignment in the input image and the type of pretrained CNN on the DP were statistically evaluated. Results: The mean DPs for histological subtype classification and differentiation in primary malignant liver tumors on DCE-CT for GR and AR were 39.1{\%}, and 47.9{\%}, respectively. The highest mean DPs for CNNs after TL with pixel shifts, rotations, and skew misalignments were 44.1{\%}, 44.2{\%}, and 43.7{\%}, respectively. Two-way analysis of variance revealed that the DP is significantly affected by the type of pretrained CNN (P = 0.0001), but not by misalignments in input images other than skew deformations. Conclusion: TL using pretrained CNNs is robust against misregistration of multiphasic images and comparable to experienced ARs in classifying primary liver cancers using three-phasic DCE-CT.},

@article{Peng2020,
abstract = {Background: We attempted to train and validate a model of deep learning for the preoperative prediction of the response of patients with intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). Method: All computed tomography (CT) images were acquired for 562 patients from the Nan Fang Hospital (NFH), 89 patients from Zhu Hai Hospital Affiliated with Jinan University (ZHHAJU), and 138 patients from the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYUCC). We built a predictive model from the outputs using the transfer learning techniques of a residual convolutional neural network (ResNet50). The prediction accuracy for each patch was revaluated in two independent validation cohorts. Results: In the training set (NFH), the deep learning model had an accuracy of 84.3{\%} and areas under curves (AUCs) of 0.97, 0.96, 0.95, and 0.96 for complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD), respectively. In the other two validation sets (ZHHAJU and SYUCC), the deep learning model had accuracies of 85.1{\%} and 82.8{\%} for CR, PR, SD, and PD. The ResNet50 model also had high AUCs for predicting the objective response of TACE therapy in patches and patients of three cohorts. Decision curve analysis (DCA) showed that the ResNet50 model had a high net benefit in the two validation cohorts. Conclusion: The deep learning model presented a good performance for predicting the response of TACE therapy and could help clinicians in better screening patients with HCC who can benefit from the interventional treatment. Key Points: • Therapy response of TACE can be predicted by a deep learning model based on CT images. • The probability value from a trained or validation deep learning model showed significant correlation with different therapy responses. • Further improvement is necessary before clinical utilization.},

Although many studies have conducted in the field, there still remain two challenges. First, the temporal enhancement pattern is hard to represent effectively. Second, the local and global information of lesions both are necessary for this task. In this paper, we proposed a framework based on deep learning, called ResGL-BDLSTM, which combines a residual deep neural network (ResNet) with global and local pathways (ResGL Net) with a bi-directional long short-term memory (BD-LSTM) model for the task of focal liver lesions classification in multi-phase CT images. In addition, we proposed a novel loss function to train the proposed framework. The loss function is composed of an inter-loss and intra-loss, which can improve the robustness of the framework. The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by achieving a 90.93{\%} mean accuracy.},

abstract = {Purpose. To evaluate the diagnostic performance of deep learning with a multichannel fusion three-dimensional convolutional neural network (MCF-3DCNN) in the differentiation of the pathologic grades of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images (DCE-MR images). Methods and Materials. Fifty-one histologically proven HCCs from 42 consecutive patients from January 2015 to September 2017 were included in this retrospective study. Pathologic examinations revealed nine well-differentiated (WD), 35 moderately differentiated (MD), and seven poorly differentiated (PD) HCCs. DCE-MR images with five phases were collected using a 3.0 Tesla MR scanner. The 4D-tensor representation was employed to organize the collected data in one temporal and three spatial dimensions by referring to the phases and 3D scanning slices of the DCE-MR images. A deep learning diagnosis model with MCF-3DCNN was proposed, and the structure of MCF-3DCNN was determined to approximate clinical diagnosis experience by taking into account the significance of the spatial and temporal information from DCE-MR images. Then, MCF-3DCNN was trained based on well-labeled samples of HCC lesions from real patient cases by experienced radiologists. The accuracy when differentiating the pathologic grades of HCC was calculated, and the performance of MCF-3DCNN in lesion diagnosis was assessed. Additionally, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) for distinguishing WD, MD, and PD HCCs were calculated. Results. MCF-3DCNN achieved an average accuracy of 0.7396±0.0104 with regard to totally differentiating the pathologic grade of HCC. MCF-3DCNN also achieved the highest diagnostic performance for discriminating WD HCCs from others, with an average AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.96, 91.00{\%}, 96.88{\%}, and 89.62{\%}, respectively. Conclusions. This study indicates that MCF-3DCNN can be a promising technology for evaluating the pathologic grade of HCC based on DCE-MR images.},

abstract = {Background: Histological grading typically reflects the biological behavior of solid tumors, thus providing valuable prognostic information. This is also expected in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), although limited access to biopsy samples and a lack of standardization might hinder its full predictive value in this cancer. Objectives: In order to better understand the current practices of histological grading in HCC, we examined the latest publications addressing its impact on the outcome of patients following surgical treatment. Methods: We searched the PubMed (MEDLINE) database under the headings "hepatocellular carcinoma," "grade OR grading," and "prognosis." Qualitative and quantitative assessment of publications was performed according to the reference they used to grade their tumors (e.g., Edmondson-Steiner, World Health Organization). Results: We reviewed a total of 216 articles: 114 enclosed adequate information and were included herein. Among these, we found divergences and inaccuracies in the histological grade assessment of this cancer, which might have led to a non-standardized grade distribution, with further impact on data analysis. Nevertheless, in most of them, poor tumor differentiation correlated with worse prognosis, expressed by lower overall and/or disease-free survival. Conclusion: While histological grading of HCC has an important prognostic role, there is an unsatisfactory heterogeneity on the microscopic assessment of this tumor, urging for a movement toward standardization.},

@article{Han2013,
abstract = {Background and Aim: Although tumor differentiation is a known prognostic factor after the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), there have not been any studies on the prognostic significance of tumor differentiation in HCC with heterogeneous histologic grades. In this study, we attempted to ascertain whether the major or the worst grade in mixed histologic type HCC determines the prognosis after liver resection. Methods: From January 1996 to March 2010, a total of 724 patients underwent curative resection of HCC at Yonsei University Health System, Korea. Of those, we excluded 99 patients who had total necrosis because of previous treatment. Among the remaining 625 patients, we compared the homogeneous moderately differentiated group (HG2, n=241), mixed histologic grades with the worst component as poorly differentiated group (M2, n=142), and homogeneous poorly differentiated group (HG3, n=156). The clinicopathologic features, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in each group were analyzed. Results: The DFS and OS were significantly lower in M2 than in HG2 (P=0.004 and 0.025, respectively) whereas those of M2 were not significantly different from HG3. There were no significant differences in the clinicopathologic features of each group except that microvascular invasion was more frequently observed in M2 than in HG2. On multivariate analysis, being in the worst histologic group (M2 and HG3) was an independent poor prognostic factor for DFS and OS (P=0.028 and {\textless}0.001, respectively). Conclusions: In patients with advanced histologic grade, the worst histologic grade may determine the prognosis after curative resection of HCC. {\textcopyright} 2013 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the diagnostic agreement of preoperative needle core biopsy (NCB) grading of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared with the final surgical pathologic tumor grade. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Some centers have adopted protocols for selecting patients with HCC for transplantation based on tumor grade as determined by preoperative NCB. The validity of NCB to predict final tumor grade has not been previously assessed. METHODS: A total of 211 patients who underwent hepatic resection, open radiofrequency, or transplantation for HCC between 1998 and 2004 were identified. Clinicopathologic, NCB, and surgical data were collected and analyzed using $\chi$ and $\kappa$ statistics. RESULTS: A total of 120 (67.4{\%}) of the 178 who underwent resection or transplantation had an NCB. On preoperative NCB, the majority of HCC cases were classified as well-differentiated (n = 35; 37.6{\%}) or moderately differentiated (n = 44; 47.3{\%}), while 14 (15.1{\%}) cases were categorized as poorly differentiated. In contrast, when tumor grading was based on the final surgical specimen, there was a significantly higher proportion of HCC cases graded as poorly differentiated (well-differentiated, n = 34; 36.6{\%}; moderately differentiated, n = 33; 35.5{\%}; poorly differentiated, n = 26; 27.9{\%}) (P {\textless} 0.05). The overall percent agreement of NCB and surgical pathology to determine tumor grade was poor ($\kappa$ = 0.18, P {\textless} 0.0001). Whereas final pathologic tumor grade predicted the presence of microscopic vascular invasion (well, 15.7{\%}; moderate; 31.9{\%}, poor; 58.4{\%}; P = 0.001), NCB grade did not (well, 23.7{\%}; moderate, 28.0{\%}; poor, 25.4{\%}; P = 0.65). CONCLUSIONS: Selection of candidates for transplantation based on NCB tumor grade may be misleading, as NCB tumor grade often did not correlate with grade or presence of microscopic vascular invasion on final pathology. Clinicomorphologic criteria (tumor size, number) should remain the major determinants of eligibility for transplantation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins, Inc.},

abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has emerged as a major cause of cancer-related death. Its mortality has increased in Western populations, with a minority of patients diagnosed at early stages, when curative treatments are feasible. Only the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib is available for the management of advanced cases. During the last 10 years, there has been a clear delineation of the landscape of genetic alterations in HCC, including high-level DNA amplifications in chromosome 6p21 (VEGFA) and 11q13 (FGF19/CNND1), as well as homozygous deletions in chromosome 9 (CDKN2A). The most frequent mutations affect TERT promoter (60{\%}), associated with an increased telomerase expression. TERT promoter can also be affected by copy number variations and hepatitis B DNA insertions, and it can be found mutated in preneoplastic lesions. TP53 and CTNNB1 are the next most prevalent mutations, affecting 25{\%}-30{\%} of HCC patients, that, in addition to low-frequency mutated genes (eg, AXIN1, ARID2, ARID1A, TSC1/TSC2, RPS6KA3, KEAP1, MLL2), help define some of the core deregulated pathways in HCC. Conceptually, some of these changes behave as prototypic oncogenic addiction loops, being ideal biomarkers for specific therapeutic approaches. Data from genomic profiling enabled a proposal of HCC in 2 major molecular clusters (proliferation and nonproliferation), with differential enrichment in prognostic signatures, pathway activation and tumor phenotype. Translation of these discoveries into specific therapeutic decisions is an unmeet medical need in this field.},

abstract = {Purpose: To elucidate the correlation between hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) enhancement patterns on dynamic MR imaging and histological findings. Materials and methods: Surgically proven 46 hypervascular HCCs of forty-one patients were enrolled. For each HCC, the signal intensity in the portal phase (SIPP) was evaluated. In this study, high, iso-, or low intensity in the portal phase was hypothesized as late, moderate, or early washout pattern, respectively. The SIPP of each HCC was correlated to histological grade and architectural subtypes that represent degrees of trabecular structure. For the trabecular HCCs, the thickness of tumor plate was also correlated for indirect estimation of tumor sinusoid. Results: There was a significant correlation between the SIPP vs. histological grade and also vs. architectural subtypes, namely the degree of trabecular structure. Washout of hypervascular HCC occurred earlier as the histological grade advanced and the histological architecture got closer to pure trabecular HCC. For the trabecular HCCs, the thickness of tumor plate correlated significantly with SIPP or histological grade. Hypervascular HCCs with thicker tumor plates showed worse histological grade and earlier washout pattern. Conclusions: Histological grade of hypervascular HCC may be predicted using SIPP. The thickness of tumor plate, resultantly the size of sinusoid between tumor plates, can account for the relationship between washout pattern and histological grade in the trabecular HCCs. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, supervised learning methods require a large amount of accurately annotated corresponding control points (or morphing), which are very difficult to obtain. Unsupervised learning methods ease the burden of manual annotation by exploiting unlabeled data without supervision. In this article, we propose a new unsupervised learning method using convolutional neural networks under an end-to-end framework, Volume Tweening Network (VTN), for 3D medical image registration. We propose three innovative technical components: (1) An end-to-end cascading scheme that resolves large displacement; (2) An efficient integration of affine registration network; and (3) An additional invertibility loss that encourages backward consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm is 880x faster (or 3.3x faster without GPU acceleration) than traditional optimization-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in medical image registration.},

@article{Zhao2019,
abstract = {We present recursive cascaded networks, a general architecture that enables learning deep cascades, for deformable image registration. The proposed architecture is simple in design and can be built on any base network. The moving image is warped successively by each cascade and finally aligned to the fixed image; this procedure is recursive in a way that every cascade learns to perform a progressive deformation for the current warped image. The entire system is end-to-end and jointly trained in an unsupervised manner. In addition, enabled by the recursive architecture, one cascade can be iteratively applied for multiple times during testing, which approaches a better fit between each of the image pairs. We evaluate our method on 3D medical images, where deformable registration is most commonly applied. We demonstrate that recursive cascaded networks achieve consistent, significant gains and outperform state-of-the-art methods. The performance reveals an increasing trend as long as more cascades are trained, while the limit is not observed. Our code will be made publicly available.},

@article{Rizzetto2020,
abstract = {Background: Radiomics is expected to improve the management of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). We aimed at evaluating the impact of liver lesion contouring as a source of variability on radiomic features (RFs). Methods: After Ethics Committee approval, 70 liver metastases in 17 CRC patients were segmented on contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans by two residents and checked by experienced radiologists. RFs from grey level co-occurrence and run length matrices were extracted from three-dimensional (3D) regions of interest (ROIs) and the largest two-dimensional (2D) ROIs. Inter-reader variability was evaluated with Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance, whilst its impact on RFs was assessed using mean relative change (MRC) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). For the main lesion of each patient, one reader also segmented a circular ROI on the same image used for the 2D ROI. Results: The best inter-reader contouring agreement was observed for 2D ROIs according to both Dice coefficient (median 0.85, interquartile range 0.78–0.89) and Hausdorff distance (0.21 mm, 0.14–0.31 mm). Comparing RF values, MRC ranged 0–752{\%} for 2D and 0–1567{\%} for 3D. For 24/32 RFs (75{\%}), MRC was lower for 2D than for 3D. An ICC {\textgreater} 0.90 was observed for more RFs for 2D (53{\%}) than for 3D (34{\%}). Only 2/32 RFs (6{\%}) showed a variability between 2D and circular ROIs higher than inter-reader variability. Conclusions: A 2D contouring approach may help mitigate overall inter-reader variability, albeit stable RFs can be extracted from both 3D and 2D segmentations of CRC liver metastases.},

@article{Tang2018,
abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly moving from an experimental phase to an implementation phase in many fields, including medicine. The combination of improved availability of large datasets, increasing computing power, and advances in learning algorithms has created major performance breakthroughs in the development of AI applications. In the last 5 years, AI techniques known as deep learning have delivered rapidly improving performance in image recognition, caption generation, and speech recognition. Radiology, in particular, is a prime candidate for early adoption of these techniques. It is anticipated that the implementation of AI in radiology over the next decade will significantly improve the quality, value, and depth of radiology's contribution to patient care and population health, and will revolutionize radiologists' workflows. The Canadian Association of Radiologists (CAR) is the national voice of radiology committed to promoting the highest standards in patient-centered imaging, lifelong learning, and research. The CAR has created an AI working group with the mandate to discuss and deliberate on practice, policy, and patient care issues related to the introduction and implementation of AI in imaging. This white paper provides recommendations for the CAR derived from deliberations between members of the AI working group. This white paper on AI in radiology will inform CAR members and policymakers on key terminology, educational needs of members, research and development, partnerships, potential clinical applications, implementation, structure and governance, role of radiologists, and potential impact of AI on radiology in Canada.},

@article{Wells2016,
abstract = {Background/Aims. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver disease that can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. This retrospective chart review investigated the incidence of hepatic steatosis in London, Ontario, Canada. Methods. A retrospective chart review was performed on emergency room (ER) patients undergoing nonscheduled computed tomography (CT) imaging over a six-month period in London, Ontario. CT images and reports were examined to determine presence of steatosis. Analyses of the electronic chart for a period of six months following the CT and communication with the patients' family doctors were used to determine if there was follow-up. Waist circumference, subcutaneous fat depth, and abdominal fat volumes were calculated. Results. 48/450 patients meeting inclusion criteria were identified by radiology as having steatosis, with 34/40 (85{\%}) family physicians unaware of the finding. 24.7{\%} (100/405) of patients met standard CT criteria for steatosis, 40 of which were reported by the radiologist. Waist circumference, subcutaneous adipose tissue depth, subcutaneous adipose tissue volume, and visceral adipose tissue volume were significantly associated with steatosis. Conclusions. The hepatic steatosis prevalence we report is the first reported in a Canadian population. Early identification of steatosis will become more important as new pharmacologic therapies arise.},
